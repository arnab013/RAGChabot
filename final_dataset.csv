combating cancer cell invasion using CPAP-tubulin inhibitors as potential cancer therapeutics. These inhibitors target centrosome amplification, a characteristic of cancer cells that contributes to increased cellular invasiveness. By modifying the behavior of extra-centrosomes, the compounds cause cancer cells to undergo mitotic catastrophe and cell death, providing a broad anti-invasive activity against various cancers, including TKI resistant EGFR and KRAS mutant cancers.

The patent presents a series of chemical compounds (I-IV) designed primarily for the treatment of various types of cancer, with a focus on lung cancer, particularly NSCLC. These compounds can exist in various forms and can be administered through multiple routes, including oral, rectal, parenteral, intravaginal, topical, bucal, extracorporeal, or as an oral or nasal spray.

The patent also discusses combination therapy using a compound from specific formulae and a second pharmacologically active compound, preferably a TKI like Imatinib, Gefitinib, Erlotinib, Sunitinib, or Cabozantinib. This therapy is applicable to a wide range of cancer types and can be administered through various routes with varying intervals.

The invention includes the use of these compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for treating cancer, particularly TKI resistant EGFR and KRAS mutant cancers, drug-resistant cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer. The patent provides examples demonstrating the effectiveness of the compounds in various cancer cell lines and their ability to enhance the anti-cancer effects of EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.

The patent also introduces compound (B), a modified version of the initial compound, which exhibits increased stability, solubility, and potent centrosome declustering activity in cancer cells. Both compounds show promise as potential anti-cancer agents, with compound (B) specifically impairing the proliferation of extra centrosome containing cells by activating extra centrosomes and enhancing microtubule nucleation.

In summary, this patent describes a novel approach for treating cancer using CPAP-tubulin inhibitors, offering a potential less toxic alternative to traditional chemotherapy for cancer cells harboring supernumerary centrosomes. The compounds can be administered through various routes and in combination with other TKIs, providing a versatile treatment option for a wide range of cancer types.","[{'document': 'WO 03097642 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2009118135 A1'}, {'document': 'US 6864238 B1'}, {'document': 'DATABASE CAPLUS, CHEMICAL ABSTRACT [online] 1 January 2011 (2011-01-01), CHERKASOV ARTEM: ""Targeting the Binding Function 3 (BF3) Site of the Human Androgen Receptor through Virtual Screening"", XP002755369, retrieved from CAPLUS; STN Database accession no. 2011-1619070'}, {'document': 'DATABASE CAPLUS, CHEMICAL ABSTRACT [online] 1 January 2011 (2011-01-01), LACK N A ET AL: ""Tarteting the Binding Function 3 (BF3) Site of the Human Androgen Receptor through Virtual Screening"", XP002755370, retrieved from CAPLUS; STN Database accession no. 2011-1407166'}, {'document': 'NATHAN A.

The primary application of this invention is in disease screening, particularly for diseases that exhibit thermoregulatory components such as SARS, smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Congo fever, viral hemorrhagic fever, Enteric fever, Meningococcal infection, tuberculosis, heat stroke, and certain animal diseases.

The invention uses thermal imaging to acquire skin temperature data from physiologically preferred sites like the forehead or eye region, converting these data into clinically significant core body temperatures via a thermal model and algorithm. The system employs in-frame temperature references, such as black body references, for improved accuracy, and a heat transfer model to relate ambient, skin, and core body temperatures.

The method provides real-time diagnosis, safety for medical personnel, and convenience for mass screening applications in various settings such as public places, military, sports events, or animal health monitoring. The patent also describes potential adaptations of the technology for measuring core body temperature in animals, including livestock and wild animals like deer and elk.

The invention's key innovation involves deriving a calibration equation (To=TS-TAK1+TA+Toffset) that takes into account the surface skin temperature (Ts), ambient temperature (TA), and an empirically determined calibration constant (K1). K1 may be modified to account for factors such as humidity and blood circulation.

The patent also suggests applications in determining diseases in other living beings, such as birds or raptors, and allows for various omissions, modifications, and changes by those skilled in the art without departing from the true scope of the invention. The technology can be implemented using image processing software, which may reside in the imaging camera or a separate computer.","[{'document': 'EP 0885587 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2004089206 A1'}, {'document': 'US 5324937 A'}, {'document': 'US 2002143257 A1'}, {'document': 'RONALD BLUM, MD.

The system consists of a manchette (pressure cuff), a pressure adjustment device, a measurement unit, an infrared camera, and an image processing device. The manchette is fitted around the extremity to cover the area of interest, and the pressure adjustment device increases or decreases the pressure within the manchette. The measurement unit measures the pressure while the infrared camera detects fluorescence emitted from a previously injected fluorescent dye in the lymph vessel. The image processing device generates and displays images showing the position of the dye in the lymph vessel.

The method involves repeatedly detecting the fluorescent dye and measuring the pressure of the manchette until the pressure decreases from a first pressure (blocking lymph flow) to a second pressure (restart of lymph flow), with this second pressure recognized as lymphatic pressure. The system can calculate the flow rate of lymph using the movement distance of the fluorescent dye and the time it takes to move over a certain distance.

The patent describes two embodiments of the system, each with slightly different configurations. The primary technical innovation is the use of a manchette (pressure cuff) with detection means linearly provided at opposite edges, which broadens the fluorescence trapping range for more reliable detection. This system allows for safer observation without exposure to radiation, lower cost, and easier measurement compared to conventional methods that involve radioisotopes.

The patent also outlines a procedure for using the system, which involves injecting the fluorescent dye into the skin or subcutaneous tissue closer to the distal end of the limb than the manchette, allowing it to flow into the lymph vessels. The subject can be in various positions or perform simple exercises. An image of the fluorescence from the dye in the lymph vessel is then captured by the infrared camera and displayed on the display unit.

The system's potential applications extend beyond lymphedema diagnosis, as it may contribute to the understanding and treatment of other lymphatic disorders. The patent also mentions possible modifications such as changing the positions or intervals of the detection units, omitting certain components like illumination means or display functions, and using different types of fluorescent dyes with various wavelength characteristics.","[{'document': 'WO 2007146489 A2'}, {'document': ""S.

The key technical innovation involves creating a core-shell structure with a silicon phase and a lithium metasilicate phase, where the lithium metasilicate phase has a particle size of ≥30nm. This design helps increase structural stability, reduce pulverization, and improve ion transmission speed for better cycling performance.

The core structure is coated with a layer that can block electrolyte entry while allowing lithium ion conduction, with a thickness of ≤30nm. The silicon phase has a particle size between 50nm and 300nm, and the ratio of the silicon phase to the lithium metasilicate phase is controlled to maximize the buffering effect of the lithium metasilicate phase on deformation of the silicon phase. The molar ratio of element silicon to element lithium in the material is limited to ensure efficient energy density increase and prevent electrode plate deformation.

The patent covers secondary batteries, battery modules, battery packs, and apparatuses using these materials, all of which are designed for high energy density and balanced cycling performance. The method for preparing this silicon-based material involves three main steps: forming primary precursor particles, dissolving residual metallic lithium, and coating the secondary precursor particles to obtain the final silicon-based material.

The prepared battery exhibits improved first-cycle coulombic efficiency and cycling performance due to the optimized particle sizes and ratios of the silicon phase and lithium metasilicate phase. The negative-electrode film layer includes the silicon-based material, a binder, a conductive agent, and other optional additives. The positive-electrode plate includes a positive-electrode active material such as a lithium transition metal oxide or an olivine-type lithium-containing phosphate.

The patent offers flexibility in the composition of both negative- and positive-electrode film layers, allowing for the inclusion of various common materials. The patent also proposes modified compounds for the positive-electrode active material to further improve the energy density of the battery. The patent describes methods for creating both positive- and negative-electrode plates, as well as the electrolyte, separator, and outer package for lithium-ion batteries.

The patent's examples demonstrate that batteries using the silicon-based materials have higher gram capacity, first-cycle coulombic efficiency, good cycling performance, and lower swelling rate compared to comparative examples due to the presence of lithium metasilicate phases with a particle size greater than 30nm. Primary applications for this invention are in the field of rechargeable batteries, particularly lithium-ion batteries, leading to more efficient energy storage and longer battery life.","[{'document': 'CN 107112521 A'}, {'document': 'CN 107112522 A'}, {'document': 'CN 110010863 A'}, {'document': 'CN 111180693 A'}, {'document': 'CN 111453713 A'}, {'document': 'CN 111710845 A'}, {'document': 'US 2017346066 A1'}]","[{'document': 'CN 111710845 A'}, {'document': 'US 2017346066 A1'}]",[],WO2022099561,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],7,"– Goal 7: The patent describes a ""secondary battery"" using a silicon-based material, which contributes to energy storage and potentially cleaner energy sources, aligning with the goal of affordable and clean energy.",Chemistry & Metallurgy; Electricity,Chemical Processes; Electrical Power,Contemporary Amperex Technology (Hong Kong) Limited,HK,1,"LIU, Xin; HUANG, Qisen; LI, Cheng; GUAN, Yingjie; WEN, Yan; LIU, Xianghui",CN,6,

The system aims to provide controlled and efficient drug delivery through the skin, improving the efficacy and convenience of hormonal drug administration.

The system consists of a backing layer, an adhesive layer, a pharmaceutical-containing polymer matrix disc layer, and an enhancer layer. The backing layer can be made from various materials such as polymer films or metal foils, while the adhesive layer is pressure-sensitive and can be attached as a ring around the sidewall of the pharmaceutical-containing disc layer.

The pharmaceutical-containing polymer matrix disc layer is created using silicone elastomers like polydimethylsiloxane, with various esters of estradiol dispersed within for controlled release over a prolonged period (typically 24 hours or more). Skin permeation enhancers are employed in both the pharmaceutical-containing disc layer and the adhesive layer to improve transdermal absorption.

The enhancer layer is made by dissolving a skin permeation enhancer in a solvent compatible with the adhesive polymer solution, and then applying it to the polymer matrix or a strippable release liner before laminating onto the polymer matrix. The amount of enhancer depends on the desired rate of pharmaceutical absorption.

The final product is a transdermal pharmaceutical dosage unit, with the size and shape of the discs being adjustable. This system offers advantages over oral administration due to reduced first-pass metabolism and hepatic destruction of the pharmaceutical, resulting in more efficient estrogen replacement therapy. The patent also proposes the use of progestins (hormones similar to progesterone) in combination with estradiol or its derivatives in the system, as well as various adhesives and skin permeation enhancers.

The primary application of this system is for transdermal estrogen replacement therapy, particularly for women experiencing menopause, oophorectomy, or pituitary failure. The use of this system aims to provide more constant pharmaceutical concentration in the body, reduce unwanted side effects, and minimize inter- and intra-patient variations.","[{'document': 'EP 0137278 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0196769 A'}, {'document': 'WO 8700042 A'}, {'document': 'WO 8701291 A'}, {'document': 'US 3598123 A'}, {'document': 'US 3996934 A'}, {'document': 'US 4291014 A'}, {'document': 'US 4321252 A'}, {'document': 'US 4438139 A'}, {'document': 'US 4460372 A'}, {'document': 'US 4559222 A'}, {'document': 'US 4568343 A'}, {'document': 'US 4573996 A'}, {'document': 'US 4585452 A'}, {'document': 'US 4624665 A'}, {'document': 'US 4666441 A'}, {'document': 'US 4668232 A'}]",[],[],WO8707138,"['AT', 'BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'FR', 'GB', 'IT', 'LI', 'LU', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent explicitly relates to ""transdermal estrogen replacement polymer matrix dosage unit"" which directly contributes to ensuring reproductive health.",Human Necessities,Medical & Healthcare,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW JERSEY",US,1,"CHIEN, Yie, W.; LEE, Chia-Shun; VALIA, Kirti, H.; CHIEN, Te-Yen",US,4,

from pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine and pyrrolidinyl moiety, which function as inhibitors for TRKA, TRKB, and/or TRKC kinases. These compounds are designed to treat various diseases mediated by TRK, including cancer, proliferative diseases, pain disorders, dermatological diseases, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, neurological diseases, immunodeficiency diseases, autoimmune diseases, bone diseases, inflammatory diseases, fibrosis, ophthalmic diseases, infectious diseases, viral diseases, and more.

The patent includes methods for synthesizing these compounds, such as the production of X-10 through a multi-step process involving specific reagents and conditions. The synthesized compounds can potentially have applications in pharmaceuticals or materials science. They are characterized by structures including heteroaromatic rings, alkyl groups, amide bonds, and various substituents such as halogens, nitro groups, and cyclopropyl rings.

The patent also covers the use of these compounds in pharmaceutical compositions for various modes of administration, such as oral, intravenous, rectal, inhalation, nasal, topical, ophthalmic, or otic administration. The compounds can be administered alone or combined with other therapeutic agents to enhance their effect.

The primary application of these compounds can be inferred to be in the field of organic chemistry for various purposes such as drug synthesis or material science. However, the patent primarily focuses on their use in treating diseases mediated by TRKA, TRKB, and/or TRKC, particularly certain types of cancer, gliomas, and hematopoietic disorders. The treatment involves administering compounds that inhibit these receptors, which are found to be overexpressed in several types of cancer.

The patent also discusses combination therapies for inflammatory and respiratory disorders, including a combination of anti-inflammatory agents, bronchodilators, and other therapeutic agents. The key technical innovations involve the use of specific polymers, surfactants, solubilizing agents, and other components to enhance the stability, solubility, and effectiveness of the compositions for various administration routes.

In summary, this patent describes a method for treating various diseases, particularly cancers, by inhibiting Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK), specifically the Trk family (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC). The treatment involves administering compounds that inhibit these receptors, which are found to be overexpressed in several types of cancer. The patent provides methods for producing these compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and discusses potential applications in pharmaceuticals or materials science.","[{'document': 'WO 2010048314 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2012034091 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2009140128 A2'}, {'document': 'Claude J.

The device consists of three parts: A, B, and C. Part A is positioned in the anterior chamber of the eye, featuring a double triangle shape for easy insertion and removal while maintaining stability. Part B punctures the corneal limbus, creating virtual spaces for draining aqueous humor from the anterior chamber to the interscleral or subconjunctival space. Part C is located outside the eye, covered by a scleral flap on the episclera or both, and can have variable measurements and finishes to increase the area of diffusion for aqueous humor in certain cases like neovascular glaucoma.

The device is made from biocompatible materials such as stainless steel, silicone, polytetrafluoroethylene, or other thin-wall polymers to minimize tissue adhesion and negative effects on eye tissues and aqueous humor. The virtual drainage path minimizes the risk of chamber flattening or bacterial penetration while reducing bleeding due to less aggressive anchorage.

The patent also discloses an ophthalmic shunt implantable in an eye with an elongate body, conduit for aqueous humor flow from the anterior chamber to the suprachoroidal space of the eye, and a shearing edge on the insertion head suitable for cutting eye tissue. Another patent describes a system for reducing IOP that includes an implantable shunt with a planar member, microchannel, and laser-introduced fenestrations in the microchannel.

The primary purpose of this technology is to reduce blindness, pain, and other illnesses associated with glaucoma by providing a less invasive procedure for controlling intraocular pressure through the drainage of aqueous humor. The device's innovative design allows aqueous humor to flow from the anterior chamber to an intrascleral space and then to the subconjunctival space, bypassing the obstructed normal pathway. However, potential complications such as flat chamber and bleeding in the anterior chamber may arise from this procedure.

The surgical procedure involves making an incision in the conjunctiva, creating a scleral flap, performing paracentesis, inserting the device into the paracentesis, closing the flap and conjunctiva with stitches, and sealing the incision. This device may be particularly beneficial for managing neovascular glaucoma by increasing the area of diffusion of aqueous humor.","[{'document': 'WO 2004056294 A1'}, {'document': 'US 5520631 A'}, {'document': 'US 5601094 A'}, {'document': 'US 5704907 A'}, {'document': 'US 5704907 A'}, {'document': 'US 5882327 A'}, {'document': 'US 2002156413 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2004254521 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2006069340 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2006155238 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2006155238 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2013150770 A1'}, {'document': 'US 7207965 B2'}]","[{'document': 'WO 5968058 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2004056294 A'}, {'document': 'US 2004254521 A'}, {'document': 'US 5520631 A'}, {'document': 'US 5704907 A'}, {'document': 'US 2006155238 A'}, {'document': 'US 2006069340 A'}]",[],WO2016003294,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent explicitly addresses glaucoma by providing a ""drainage device for controlling intraocular pressure in glaucoma"", which directly contributes to combating this disease.",Human Necessities,Medical & Healthcare,MM INSTRUMENTS LLC,US,1,"MIRANDA VELASQUEZ, Mario Eduardo",PE,1,

from a steam explosion plant used in the production of biomass pellets or briquettes. This technology aims to improve both economic feasibility and environmental performance by utilizing waste steam (blow-steam) generated during the process.

The method involves condensing blow-steam, recovering heat from this condensation to energize a fractionation system where volatile hydrocarbon compounds are recovered from the blow-steam condensate. The recovered heat is then used for drying the biomass used in the steam explosion reactor, thereby improving energy recovery and reducing operational costs.

The invention applies not only to steam explosion plants but also to biorefineries, where the recovered volatile hydrocarbons can be further refined for various uses such as solvents, fuel, resin, fungicides, nematicides, and others. The patent describes an energy recovery system that utilizes waste heat (blow-steam) from a steam explosion plant or biorefinery for two primary purposes: furfural recovery and biomass drying.

The system employs a unique design for the reboiler, which is a ""falling film reboiler."" The recovered furfural is then further purified in a second column, and the water phase containing some furfural is returned as reflux to the distillation column. The operational cost of furfural recovery is kept low due to the efficient use of heat in the system.

The patent also mentions various methods for recovering furfural in the fractionation system, including stripping, distillation, dehydration, decanting, reflux condensing, and re-boiling bottoms of fractionation columns. The system operates with a high reflux rate, which is typically uneconomical in fractionation but is not a problem due to the recovery of heat in the reflux condenser and its subsequent use for biomass drying.

The invention offers significant energy savings by reusing heat that would otherwise be wasted, making it applicable when the final energy user provides a low-temperature heat sink, ensuring a substantial temperature driving force for efficient heat transfer. The patent also mentions its potential application in biorefineries where steam explosion reactors are used for hydrolysis of biomass sugars for ethanol and other product production.","[{'document': 'WO 2016020269 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2018104485 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2018122454 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2019093938 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 9315816 A1'}, {'document': 'No further relevant documents disclosed'}]","[{'document': 'US 1578609 A'}, {'document': 'US 7303707 B'}, {'document': 'NO 327839'}, {'document': 'NO 320971'}, {'document': 'NO 20130279'}, {'document': 'US 1922313 A'}, {'document': 'US 2616802 A'}, {'document': 'DE 19905655'}, {'document': 'SE 541264'}, {'document': 'WO 2018122454 A1'}, {'document': 'K.J.

diseases, including autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases (particularly type II diabetes), neurological and neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease), cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, asthma, hormone-related diseases, and viral infections.

The patent emphasizes the crucial role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in insulin-induced signaling pathways related to type II diabetes, where its inhibition leads to increased glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake, potentially benefiting diabetic patients with an impaired insulin response. Additionally, GSK-3 is associated with Alzheimer's disease due to its promotion of neurofibrillary tangle formation containing hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Inhibition of GSK-3 could prevent hyperphosphorylation and potentially treat Alzheimer's disease and other psychotic and neurodegenerative disorders.

The patent also suggests potential applications of these compounds in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, or materials science due to their diverse structures and substitutions. These compounds can be synthesized using various methods known to those skilled in the art and administered through various routes depending on the severity of the infection being treated.

The patent presents a new invention of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing compounds that inhibit PIM-1, CDK-2, SRC, or GSK-3, which can potentially treat various diseases such as proliferative disorders, cardiac disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, psychotic disorders, autoimmune disorders, conditions associated with organ transplant, inflammatory disorders, immunologically mediated disorders, viral diseases, and bone disorders. The patent also introduces a compound (formula I) that can inhibit PIM-1, CDK-2, SRC, and GSK-3 activity in a patient or biological sample, useful for blood transfusion, organ-transplantation, biological specimen storage, and biological assays.

The patent further includes a polymer-based coating system for controlled release applications, using polymers like polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and various combinations. The primary applications of these compounds would be in the treatment of diseases where these enzymes play significant roles, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, viral infections, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. The patent also includes examples of the synthesis of these compounds and provides NMR and MS data for the synthesized compounds, with several compounds showing inhibition levels below 1.0 µM for PIM-1 and below 2.0 µM for GSK-3, CDK-2, and SRC.","[{'document': 'WO 9967245 A'}, {'document': 'WO 02083139 A'}, {'document': 'WO 02083675 A'}, {'document': 'WO 03074525 A'}, {'document': 'DE 2215999 A'}, {'document': 'DE 2254783 A'}, {'document': 'DE 2261693 A'}, {'document': 'DE 2261735 A'}, {'document': 'DE 10038019 A'}, {'document': 'US 6255305 B1'}, {'document': 'BRATUSEK ET AL.: ""Synthesis and reactivity of (Z)-3-benzoylamino-4-dimethylamino-2-oxo-3 -butene.

The innovation lies in the utilization of food red dyes as stabilizers within these solid preparations, offering superior stability compared to previous techniques focused on aqueous solutions.

The method involves incorporating the red dye into the solid preparation containing either cobamamide or mecobalamin, either by directly mixing both powders or individually granulating each component before combining them. The patent recommends New Coccine as an optimal stabilizer due to its excellent stability and appearance in the solid preparation. The amount of red dye added ranges from 0.1 to 5 parts based on one part of cobamamide or mecobalamin.

The resulting solid preparations can take various forms, such as powder, granule, capsule, or tablet. Suitable food-grade red dyes for this method include Amaranth, Erythrocin, New Coccine, Phloxine, Rose Bengale, and Acid Red. The patent provides examples demonstrating the stabilizing effect of the method compared to control specimens without the red dye, particularly when using New Coccine.

The primary applications of this invention are in the production of stable granules and capsules containing these vitamins, which can be used in various pharmaceutical and nutritional products.

particularly dye-sensitized and solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The key technical advancement lies in the use of mixed-halide perovskites as a sensitizer, replacing traditional dyes or redox active electrolytes. These mixed-halide perovskites, composed of an organic cation, a divalent metal cation, and two or more different halide anions (one being iodide), lead to stable, high-performance solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 11.5% and photocurrents of 21 mAcm-2.

The mixed-halide perovskites are advantageous due to their abundance, affordability, and ease of production using simple wet chemistry processes, making large-scale production feasible. These compounds find applications in various optoelectronic devices such as photodiodes, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and lasers.

The primary application of these mixed-halide perovskites is in the development of high-performance, energy-efficient LEDs due to their excellent optical properties. The patent describes an optoelectronic device that utilizes a transparent or semi-transparent FTO anode and a high work function metal cathode, with a perovskite layer as the active sensitizer material disposed between the electrodes.

The process for producing mixed-halide perovskites involves dissolving two compounds containing a metal cation (such as Pb) and either iodide or another halide in a solvent, followed by mixing to create a mixed-halide perovskite material. The patent provides examples of various perovskites used in these devices, such as CH3NH3PbBrI2, CH3NH3PbIBr2, and CH3NH3SnF2I.

The optoelectronic device may further include encapsulated metal nanoparticles disposed between the first and second electrodes to improve the stability and efficiency of the devices. The mixed-halide perovskites used in these devices can potentially offer improved stability and efficiency compared to single-halide perovskites.

The patent also describes a method for creating high-performance solid-state perovskite sensitized solar cells, with key technical innovations including the use of titanium chloride (TiCl4) to treat an n-type semiconductor layer, the deposition of a sensitizer layer and a charge transporting layer using specific materials and solutions, and the formation of mixed halide perovskites for the photoactive layer. The primary applications are in photovoltaics, where these solar cells can efficiently convert sunlight into electricity with improved stability compared to single-halide perovskite counterparts.

The use of formamidinium cations in creating mixed halide perovskites is also mentioned as an unexpected advantage. This patent offers a significant leap forward in the development of high-performance, energy-efficient optoelectronic devices and solar cells with improved stability compared to traditional counterparts.","[{'document': 'US 6429318 B1'}, {'document': 'KITAZAWA N ET AL: ""Optical properties of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = halogen) and their mixed-halide crystals"", JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE, KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS, BO, vol. 37, no. 17, 1 September 2002 (2002-09-01), pages 3585-3587, XP019209691, ISSN: 1573-4803, DOI: 10.1023/A:1016584519829'}, {'document': 'DAVID B.

The method involves truncating and replacing specific regions of the L1 protein to improve its expression and solubility, followed by connecting N-terminal and C-terminal fragments from different HPV types to create chimeric proteins. These chimeric proteins are then used to produce virus-like particles (VLPs) that self-assemble in an in vivo expression system. The primary purpose of this invention is the prevention of HPV-related diseases or infections, including those not currently covered by commercial vaccines. The potential outcome is the creation of polyvalent vaccines for comprehensive protection against a wide range of HPV infections. Adjuvants are also incorporated to enhance the effectiveness of the VLPs.

The patent further describes the synthesis and construction of chimeric HPV L1 proteins for specific types (35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, and 58) by fusing the N-terminal region of one HPV type with the C-terminal region of another (HPV Type 33). These chimeric proteins may have potential applications in vaccine development due to their potential ability to induce a broader immune response.

It's important to note that while this invention offers promising potential, the effectiveness of these VLPs and chimeric proteins has not been confirmed through experimental results or real-world applications as stated in the patent text.","[{'document': 'WO 0197840 A1'}, {'document': 'CN 101518647 A'}, {'document': 'CN 102268076 A'}, {'document': 'CN 102747047 A'}, {'document': 'CN 106795518 A'}, {'document': 'US 5821087 A'}, {'document': 'LUXEMBOURG ALAIN ET AL: ""Phase II studies to select the formulation of a multivalent HPV L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine"", HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, vol. 11, no. 6, 27 April 2015 (2015-04-27), US, pages 1313 - 1322, XP093007309, ISSN: 2164-5515, DOI: 10.1080/21645515.2015.1012010'}, {'document': 'ZHANG T ET AL: ""Trivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) VLP vaccine covering HPV type 58 can elicit high level of humoral immunity but also induce immune interference among component types"", VACCINE, ELSEVIER, AMSTERDAM, NL, vol. 28, no. 19, 26 April 2010 (2010-04-26), pages 3479 - 3487, XP026997130, ISSN: 0264-410X, [retrieved on 20100306]'}, {'document': 'NEIL D CHRISTENSEN ET AL: ""Hybrid papillomavirus L1 molecules assemble into virus-like particles that reconstitute conformational epitopes and induce neutralizing antibodies to distinct HPV types"", VIROLOGY, ELSEVIER, AMSTERDAM, NL, vol. 291, no. 2, 20 December 2001 (2001-12-20), pages 324 - 334, XP002280750, ISSN: 0042-6822, DOI: 10.1006/VIRO.2001.1220'}, {'document': 'MATHIEU BOXUS ET AL: ""Broad Cross-Protection Is Induced in Preclinical Models by a Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Composed of Ll/L2 Chimeric Virus-Like Particles"", JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY, vol. 90, no. 14, 15 July 2016 (2016-07-15), US, pages 6314 - 6325, XP055422243, ISSN: 0022-538X, DOI: 10.1128/JVI.00449-16'}, {'document': 'WANG DANING ET AL: ""Rational design of a multi-valent human papillomavirus vaccine by capsomere-hybrid co-assembly of virus-like particles"", NATURE COMMUNICATIONS, vol. 11, no. 1, 5 June 2020 (2020-06-05), XP055919924, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16639-1> DOI: 10.1038/s41467-020-16639-1'}]","[{'document': 'WO 0197840 A'}, {'document': 'US 6361778 B1'}, {'document': 'E.-M.

The resulting modified galactomannan has improved interactive properties similar to locust bean gum, which is currently more expensive and scarce.

The process involves incubating a hydrated preparation containing 2-70% by weight of galactomannan with a specific alpha-galactosidase enzyme preparation, aiming to reduce the galactose content from its original range of 35-45% to a new range of 10-30%, preferably below 27%. The modified galactomannan contains less galactose (preferably between 13 and 25%) and has superior gelling properties with molecular weights typically in the range from 1 to 2.5 millions.

The enzymatic reaction is carried out at temperatures between 0 and 70°C, usually between 40 and 60°C. Suitable enzymes can be of vegetable or microbial origin. After the enzymatic treatment, the galactomannan is deactivated and dried by conventional methods.

The modified galactomannan can be used in various applications where gelling properties are important, such as foodstuffs (human and animal), cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications. It can also be combined with other polysaccharides like agarose, agar, carageenan, and xanthan to take advantage of synergistic interactions.

The patent includes experiments demonstrating the effect of substrate concentration on the rate of release of D-galactose from guar galactomannan by alpha-galactosidase enzyme, optimizing the hydrolysis of guar galactomannan using alpha-galactosidase enzymes. The method is demonstrated through various examples and discussions on the effects of different variations on the properties of the modified guar galactomannan.

The primary application of this invention appears to be in the food industry, specifically in the production of ice cream and potentially other products that require stabilizers or thickeners with specific properties. The patent describes two methods (Methods A and B) for modifying guar gum using alpha-galactosidase II enzyme, resulting in a modified guar gum with altered galactose/mannose ratios. The modified guar gum interacts similarly to locust bean gum with xanthan, forming gels unlike unmodified guar gum. This modification allows for the creation of new hydrocolloid systems.

The primary application of this innovation is in the creation of new hydrocolloid systems for various industries such as food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics where modified guar gum can be used as a thickening, gelling, and stabilizing agent. The patent explores the effects of temperature, guar concentration, and enzyme dosage on the reaction rate and extent of modification, comparing the performance of alpha-galactosidase II from germinating guar seeds with those from lucerne and fenugreek seeds.","[{'document': 'Phytochemistry, vol.22 (1983), pp. 649-658'}, {'document': 'CARBOHYDRATE RESEARCH, vol. 92, 1981, pages 269-285, Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam, NL; B.V.

The process involves combining organic waste such as livestock and poultry manure, sewage sludge, and agroindustrial processing wastes with inorganic materials like phosphate, potash, and trace minerals. Acid is added to lower the pH and initiate chemical breakdown of the organic material, followed by curing, aeration, and cooling steps. Ammonia is then introduced to raise the pH and form a stable fertilizer that provides slow-release nutrients for plants.

The patent also describes an apparatus for manufacturing this specific type of fertilizer. The process includes three hoppers containing coal, rock phosphate, potash, and other minerals. Materials are mixed in a paddle-type mixer with the addition of water, acid, and measured amounts of base material like ammonia. The mixture is cured, cooled, and aerated before being further processed in another mixer to adjust the pH level and achieve a desired nutrient content (e.g., 5-5-0-6 for N-P-K-S).

diseases associated with Autotaxin (ATX), including cancer, fibrotic diseases, inflammatory diseases, ophthalmic diseases, urological diseases, type II diabetes-related obesity, and acute coronary syndrome. These compounds are characterized by specific chemical structures, including a ring A and various substituents R1 to R3.

The production process involves two main steps: (1) the reaction of compound A1 with bis(pinacolato)diborane in a solvent, in the presence of a transition metal complex and a base, to produce compound A2; followed by (2) the reaction of compound A2 with compound A3 in a solvent, again in the presence of a transition metal complex and a base, to produce the final compounds. Key technical innovations involve the use of palladium catalyst precursors with various ligands in these production methods.

The primary applications of these produced compounds appear to be in organic synthesis, potentially for pharmaceutical or materials science purposes. They can also be used in combination with other medicaments for treating specific diseases, and the dosage varies depending on factors such as age, body weight, general health condition, sex, administration time, administration method, clearance rate, level of disease state, and others.

The patent describes methods for producing various intermediates (M1-W4) used in pharmaceutical synthesis. The primary applications of these compounds are in the treatment or prevention of diseases involving ATX, such as cancer/tumors, fibrotic diseases, inflammatory diseases, ophthalmic diseases, urological diseases, type II diabetes-related obesity, and acute coronary syndrome. The unique structure of these compounds allows them to interact with specific biological targets, potentially offering improved efficacy and reduced side effects compared to existing treatments.

The patent also includes a method for creating a Macaca fascicularis laser-induced high intraocular pressure model to study the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of an ATX inhibitor on this non-human primate model. The study found that the ATX inhibitor showed statistically significant intraocular pressure-lowering action on both single oral administration and single instillation administration routes.

Additionally, the patent describes a method for diagnosing and monitoring various diseases by analyzing the expression levels of microRNA biomarkers in body fluids such as blood or urine. The primary application is for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of diseases to improve treatment outcomes.

The patent's primary application lies in the pharmaceutical industry as a potential drug for diseases caused by autotaxin, such as various cancers or tumors, fibrous diseases, and other mentioned conditions. The patent builds upon Patent Application No. 2018-141254 filed in Japan.","[{'document': 'WO 2012005227 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2013061297 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2014139882 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2014202458 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2015163435 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2017033966 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2009046841 A2'}, {'document': 'WO 2012024620 A2'}, {'document': 'JP 2016164154 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2017078039 A'}]","[{'document': 'WO 2012005227 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2012024620 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2009046841 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2013061297 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2015163435 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2014139882 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2014202458 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2018141254 A'}, {'document': 'CHOI et al.

patent describes an innovative minimally invasive system for repairing heart valves, specifically addressing mitral valve regurgitation. The system involves a suture attachment catheter that accesses the heart intravascularly and attaches a suture as an artificial chordae to a beating heart's valve leaflet. This catheter device is designed primarily for surgical procedures involving mitral valve repair or replacement, where it can capture and retain a leaflet, stabilize it, and potentially route sutures for repair or replacement.

The catheter consists of two hinged jaws, one distal and one proximal, with suture slots and channels in the catheter body to hold the sutures. The sutures are doubled within each channel and held in place by a separate looped suture connected to a spring in the control handle. A needle is advanced through a needle support tube to penetrate the leaflet and insert the suture around it.

Key technical innovations include a flexible catheter body with a total working length between 100 cm and 170 cm, capable of flexing around curves up to 38.1 mm in diameter. The distal jaw is hingedly attached to a rail, while the proximal jaw slides along this rail. The distal jaw includes stepped ridges on its clamping surface to enhance its ability to clamp and retain a valve leaflet. The proximal jaw has elongate slots that define both suture slots and needle holes for routing one or more pre-installed sutures.

Actuation of the jaws is achieved using flexible members (nitinol wire) connected to the distal and proximal jaws, which can be controlled from a proximal end of the device. The hinged connection of the distal jaw allows it to flex as needed while advancing through small radii during delivery, reducing its rigid length.

The patent also describes various embodiments of the system, including designs with a stationary proximal jaw and a slideable rail to adjust the distance between jaws, and another version designed for single-suture use. These designs may include features such as keying wires to retain needles in place and stabilizing loops to aid in leaflet capture.

The system includes a handle design for controlling the leaflet capture catheter during a mitral valve repair procedure, with control elements like a rail slide actuation member, a flexible member actuation nut, and a control knob that can perform both functions with a single element. The handle also contains a needle release assembly for puncturing the leaflet and retrieving the suture back through it.

The system is designed to be adjustable, with various materials, dimensions, shapes, implantation locations, etc., being possible. The patent claims that the described embodiments are not exhaustive and can be combined in various ways to produce numerous additional embodiments. This technology could potentially revolutionize heart valve repair procedures by making them less invasive and risky for patients.","[{'document': 'WO 2019183626 A1'}, {'document': 'KR 100944411 B1'}, {'document': 'US 6126058 A'}, {'document': 'US 2007118151 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2009105751 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2010137889 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2013041387 A1'}, {'document': 'US 9572556 B2'}]","[{'document': 'US 8465500 B Speziali'}, {'document': 'US 8758393 B'}, {'document': 'US 9192374 B Zentgraf'}, {'document': 'WO 2019183626 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2007118151 A1'}, {'document': 'KR 100944411 B1'}, {'document': 'US 6126058 A'}, {'document': 'US 20070118151 A'}, {'document': 'US 20130035757 A'}, {'document': 'US 7635386 B'}, {'document': 'US 8043368 B'}, {'document': 'US 8545551 B'}, {'document': 'US 62647162 20180323'}, {'document': 'US 363701'}, {'document': 'US 10588620 B2'}, {'document': 'US 406736'}, {'document': 'US 11253360 B2'}, {'document': 'US 16406764 B2'}, {'document': 'US 11173030 B2'}, {'document': 'US 16406799 B2'}, {'document': 'US 20190343634 A1'}, {'document': 'US 9044221 B'}]",[],WO2020051583,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""suture attachment catheter configured to repair a heart valve"", which directly contributes to reducing mortality from non-communicable diseases.",Human Necessities,Medical & Healthcare,"NeoChord, Inc.",US,1,"CAFFES, Levi; HELGERSON, Joel; SCHIFLE, Andrew; EDMISTON, Daryl; GARVIN, Graham",US,5,

The key technical innovation lies in the use of particulate compounds composed of iodinated carbonate esters, which offer advantages over previous contrast agents due to reduced toxicity, improved stability, higher iodine content, and faster metabolism.

The synthesis process involves dissolving appropriate carbonates and triiodinated benzene derivatives in solvents like chloroform or DMF, adding a base, and reacting at various temperatures for specified periods. The resulting products are then purified through processes such as filtration, washing, drying, and evaporation.

The synthesized compounds are primarily used in the preparation of microparticles for pharmaceutical use, with mean diameters ranging from 1.45 to 3.5 microns. These microparticles can be dispersed or suspended in various solutions for injection, and the patent describes two specific formulations: one with only the microparticles and another with the microparticles suspended in a solution containing bovine serum albumin (BSA).

In vitro biodegradation tests demonstrate that these formulations exhibit superior degradation rates compared to Isopaque, a commonly used substance. In vivo metabolism studies on rats reveal that approximately 70% of the dose is found in the liver within 15 minutes, with stable iodine content for up to 3 hours before decreasing. The particles are primarily excreted through the urine and bile.

Furthermore, the patent mentions the use of these formulations for CT studies in rabbits, demonstrating that they can enhance liver contrast more effectively than iohexol, a commonly used vascular contrast medium, in a Siemens CT scanner. This invention offers potential benefits over existing contrast agents in terms of safety, efficiency, and convenience, making it advantageous for medical imaging applications focused on the visualization of the liver and spleen.","[{'document': 'GB 2157283 A'}, {'document': 'US 4018783 A'}]",[],[],WO9007491,"['AT', 'BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'DK', 'ES', 'FR', 'GB', 'IT', 'LI', 'LU', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes an ""injectable contrast medium"" used to enhance ""an xray or ultrasound image of the liver andor spleen"", which directly relates to improving diagnostics and healthcare.",Chemistry & Metallurgy; Human Necessities,Chemical Processes; Medical & Healthcare,NYCOMED IMAGING AS,NO,1,"KLAVENESS, Jo; STRANDE, Per",NO,2,

This bacterium exhibits unique characteristics, including little to no ability to sporulate, which allows for extended periods of growth and metabolite production, thereby increasing overall efficiency in fermentation processes.

The primary application of this invention is in the biofuel industry, particularly in the conversion of industrial waste gases containing CO into ethanol. The preferred substrate contains at least 70% CO by volume and less than 20% H2 by volume, with higher ratios providing even better results.

The method involves culturing the bacteria in a nutrient media, maintaining a constant pH by adding fresh media, and removing a portion of the media to maintain a constant volume. This process selects for fast-growing micro-organisms that produce acetate as a by-product. The invention provides a biologically pure isolate of this bacterium, which can produce ethanol at high concentrations (up to 3.4g/L) with an ethanol-to-acetate ratio of at least 1.0.

The patent also describes methods for reducing atmospheric carbon emissions by capturing CO-containing gas from industrial processes like steel mills and using it for anaerobic fermentation to produce alcohols. The bacteria can tolerate a wide range of H2 and CO2 levels in the substrate, but optimal results are achieved with low H2 (preferably less than 5%) and moderate CO2 (at most 15%).

The invention offers potential applications in various industrial processes such as ferrous and non-ferrous metal production, petroleum refining, biomass and coal gasification, electric power production, carbon black production, ammonia production, methanol production, and coke manufacturing. The captured CO-containing gas can be obtained from these industrial processes, particularly steel mills.

The patent also covers methods for the production of alcohols from CO-containing gases, as well as a method to reduce atmospheric carbon emissions by capturing CO-containing gas from industrial processes and using it for anaerobic fermentation to produce alcohols. The bacteria can be maintained in minimal anaerobic microbial growth media or supplemented with additional components like amino acids, trypticase, or yeast extract, although the highest efficiency is achieved without yeast extract.

The fermentation process can occur in various bioreactor types, such as continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR), bubble column reactors (BCR), or trickle bed reactors (TBR). Ethanol recovery methods include fractional distillation, evaporation, and extractive fermentation. The patent also describes a method for extracting ethanol and acetate from a fermentation broth using oleyl alcohol as a solvent.

In summary, the patent presents a novel strain of bacteria capable of efficiently producing ethanol through anaerobic fermentation, particularly when supplied with a CO-rich and H2-poor gaseous substrate. The invention provides potential applications in biofuel production from industrial waste gases, as well as methods for reducing atmospheric carbon emissions by capturing CO-containing gas from industrial processes and using it for anaerobic fermentation to produce alcohols.","[{'document': 'EP 1550714 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 0068407 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2007117157 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2009022925 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 0208438 A2'}, {'document': 'WO 2008028055 A2'}, {'document': 'US 5173429 A'}, {'document': 'US 6136577 A'}, {'document': 'US 2007275447 A1'}, {'document': 'NAJAFPOUR G ET AL: ""Ethanol and acetate synthesis from waste gas using batch culture of Clostridium ljungdahlii"", ENZYME AND MICROBIAL TECHNOLOGY, STONEHAM, MA, US, vol. 38, no. 1-2, 3 January 2006 (2006-01-03), pages 223-228, XP025094935, ISSN: 0141-0229, DOI: DOI:10.1016/J.ENZMICTEC.2005.06.008 [retrieved on 2006-01-03]'}, {'document': 'HENSTRA ET AL: ""Microbiology of synthesis gas fermentation for biofuel production"", CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY, LONDON, GB, vol. 18, no. 3, 8 June 2007 (2007-06-08), pages 200-206, XP022110181, ISSN: 0958-1669, DOI: DOI:10.1016/J.COPBIO.2007.03.008'}, {'document': 'RAINEY F A ET AL: ""PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF ANAEROBIC THERMOPHILIC BACTERIA: AID FOR THEIR RECLASSIFICATION"", JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY, AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGY, WASHINGTON, DC; US, vol. 175, no. 15, 1 August 1993 (1993-08-01), pages 4772-4779, XP000564368, ISSN: 0021-9193'}, {'document': ""YOUNESI, H.

describes an innovative method for determining a locomotive's speed, direction, and displacement using satellite positioning data. The key advantage of this approach is its independence from traditional interfaces or line data, improving adaptability, reducing cost, and simplifying operation and maintenance.

The method involves classifying the locomotive into four states: initial, invalid satellite positioning, low speed, and credible speed. In the credible speed state, real-time direction angle information and a combination of speed and direction are used to calculate the locomotive's speed, direction, and displacement. In the low speed state, position change is utilized for these calculations. When satellite positioning fails, the system maintains the last valid position information (longitude and latitude) and compensates displacement once the satellite positioning resumes.

The patent provides specific calculation methods for different states and offers advantages such as high independence, high adaptability, reduced interface cost, and avoidance of line data making costs. This method can be used as a supplement to existing traditional speed and distance measurement methods in locomotive systems, providing more accurate results by comprehensively calculating these indicators.

The primary application of this technology is for rail transportation systems where accurate speed, direction, and displacement information are essential for safe and efficient operation, particularly in areas where satellite positioning may fail or be unreliable. This patent's innovation lies in its ability to maintain accurate positioning data even during satellite failures, ensuring navigation, safety, and operational efficiency.","[{'document': 'WO 2017020667 A1'}, {'document': 'CN 101210960 A'}, {'document': 'CN 107923981 A'}, {'document': 'CN 109849978 A'}, {'document': 'CN 110914710 A'}, {'document': 'CN 111913419 A'}, {'document': 'CN 111913419 A'}, {'document': 'CN 112578420 A'}, {'document': 'KR 101255013 B1'}, {'document': 'US 2011285583 A1'}]","[{'document': 'WO 2017020667 A1'}, {'document': 'CN 111913419 A'}]",[],WO2022134685,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],9,"– Goal 9: The patent describes ""a locomotive operation state detection method based on satellite positioning"", which contributes to developing reliable and sustainable infrastructure.",Performing Operations & Transport; Physics,Nuclear Technology; Transportation & Vehicles,CASCO SIGNAL LTD.,CN,1,"HAN, Ge'er; CHENG, Jiajia; JIA, Qingwen; WANG, Shijing; LUO, Yina; WANG, Ping",CN,6,

The key technical innovation lies in the use of isotropic pitch as a raw material, offering advantages such as simplicity in production, improved workability, high electrostatic capacitance, and low expansion.

The process involves converting granular isotropic pitch into an infusible state before activation to prevent melting adhesion between the granules. The conversion process includes heating the pitch in the presence of oxygen gas under specific temperature and time conditions. The activated carbon obtained can be refined through washing, pulverization, granulation, or drying steps to reduce heavy metal content.

The preferred chemical agents for activating the carbon are alkali metal compounds like potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, which are added at a specific amount before activation at temperatures between 500-900°C. The activation process involves moistening, solidifying, and heat treating the mixture of pitch and chemical agent.

The activated carbon produced exhibits a specific surface area preferably between 50-4000 m2/g and a total amount of functional groups on its surface should be 2.5 meq/g or less for optimal endurance. It is then mixed with an electroconductive filler like carbon black and a binder to form a paste that can be used to create coat or sheet electrodes for EDLCs.

The electric double layer capacitor made from these electrodes exhibits low expansion (40% or below) after charge and discharge, making it superior in mechanical strength. The patent provides examples of solvents, electrolytes, and materials used in the production process.

The primary application of this invention is in the field of electronics, particularly as a power source for microcomputers, timers, control sections, electrical equipment, backup power sources, and car applications. This patent offers a significant advancement in the production of capacitors with improved electrostatic capacitance and low-expansibility electrodes compared to traditional methods.","[{'document': 'EP 0927778 A'}, {'document': 'GB 1383085 A'}, {'document': 'US 4420443 A'}, {'document': 'US 5387333 A'}, {'document': 'PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 018, no. 248 (C-1198), 12 May 1994 (1994-05-12) & JP 06 032609 A (NIPPON STEEL CORP), 8 February 1994 (1994-02-08)'}, {'document': 'PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 017, no. 551 (C-1117), 5 October 1993 (1993-10-05) & JP 05 155673 A (KAWASAKI STEEL CORP), 22 June 1993 (1993-06-22)'}, {'document': 'PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 2000, no. 01, 31 January 2000 (2000-01-31) & JP 11 293527 A (PETOCA LTD), 26 October 1999 (1999-10-26)'}, {'document': 'MONDORI ET AL: ""Influence of properties of coal tars on opreparation of isotropic pitch precursor, general purpose carbon fiber and activated carbon fiber.""

describes a groundbreaking system and method for optimizing traffic signal preemption, primarily aimed at improving response times for emergency vehicles and enhancing efficiency for transit vehicles at intersections. This innovative technology employs operating system-level virtualization to create multiple virtual phase selectors (VPS), each responsible for managing traffic signal preemption requests independently.

The key technical innovations include:
1. Operating system-level virtualization, enabling the creation of VPS that can manage traffic signal preemption requests dynamically and independently.
2. Dynamically activated VPS, which are started and stopped based on the presence or absence of vehicle messages within a certain threshold period.
3. The use of geographical coordinates in vehicle messages to associate them with specific VPS and intersections.
4. Preemption request with a security code indicative of low priority.
5. Virtual phase selectors that discriminate between high and low priority requests.
6. A scheduler to control starting and stopping execution of VPS based on locations subscribed-to by the selectors.
7. Use of location subscriptions for distributing vehicle messages having traffic signal priority requests.
8. Scheduler mapping location information for each traffic signal controller to an identifier of a virtual phase selector assigned to that traffic signal controller.
9. Subscribing to location topics with the message broker and commencing processing of received vehicle messages.
10. Virtual phase selectors generating and communicating preemption requests to the associated traffic signal controller when necessary.

The system prioritizes emergency vehicles (like ambulances) at intersections by using VPS, which are controlled by a scheduler and subscribe to specific locations. When a vehicle message indicating the location of an emergency vehicle is received, the scheduler starts the relevant virtual phase selector, which then sends a preemption request to the traffic signal controller to keep the lights green for the approaching ambulance while turning red for other vehicles (like buses).

The system reduces communication and computational resource requirements by using location subscriptions. This technology can improve emergency response times and traffic flow efficiency. The patent also discusses potential uses in various applications such as warning pedestrians of approaching emergency vehicles, alerting civilian vehicles of nearby emergency vehicles, and alerting drones to nearby drones.

In essence, the system efficiently handles vehicle message processing by determining whether a vehicle is within a specific geographic area based on comparison of character strings representing coordinates. This approach reduces processing and communication requirements associated with traffic signal preemption requests. The patent describes a system for managing the distribution of vehicle messages from multiple sources (vehicles) to specific subscribers based on geographical locations, using location subscriptions that implicitly cover areas defined by approaches, which can be rectangular or polygonal.","[{'document': 'US 2007008173 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2011109477 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2011234423 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2012136559 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2019272748 A1'}, {'document': 'ANONYMOUS: ""Docker run reference| Docker Documentation"", 28 March 2019 (2019-03-28), pages 1 - 22, XP093094592, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://web.archive.org/web/20190328055018/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/> [retrieved on 20231024]'}, {'document': 'PADMAPRABHU NITHIN ET AL: ""A GPS CLOUD-BASED IOT SOLUTION FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES TO BYPASS TRAFFIC"", 12 October 2012 (2012-10-12), pages 1 - 13, XP093094623, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://aetransport.org/private/downloads/WXU-36l9EUAxt639I116ykTx4Ik/ETC-2018-ITCS.pdf> [retrieved on 20231024]'}, {'document': 'ALMURAYKHI KHALID M ET AL: ""STLS: Smart Traffic Lights System for Emergency Response Vehicles"", 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES (ICCIS), IEEE, 3 April 2019 (2019-04-03), pages 1 - 6, XP033550868, DOI: 10.1109/ICCISCI.2019.8716429'}, {'document': 'ANONYMOUS: ""MQTT man page | Eclipse Mosquitto"", 9 June 2020 (2020-06-09), pages 1 - 4, XP093095851, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://web.archive.org/web/20200609082844/https://mosquitto.org/man/mqtt-7.html> [retrieved on 20231027]'}, {'document': 'ANONYMOUS: ""Beginners Guide To The MQTT Protocol"", 9 June 2020 (2020-06-09), pages 1 - 20, XP093095854, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://web.archive.org/web/20200609082844/http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mqtt/> [retrieved on 20231027]'}]","[{'document': 'US 2019272748 A'}, {'document': 'STLS: Smart Traffic Lights System for Emergency Response Vehicles ALMURAYKHI KHALID M et al. 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES (ICCIS) IEEE 20190403 1 6'}, {'document': 'PADMAPRABHU NITHIN et al.

patients with weak muscles. The device is portable, cost-effective, and adaptable to various surfaces, enabling users to perform exercises in diverse environments.

The device consists of a base plate, mounting plate, and a rehabilitation exercise unit with supports for hands/feet, forearms/calves, and upper arms/thighs, connected by hinges that allow for various movements. The mounting plate is horizontally movable and tiltable to accommodate different user conditions. A link member adjusts the angle between the base plate and the mounting plate, mimicking normal joint motion during rehabilitation exercises.

The device's key technical innovation involves a slide-crank mechanism that allows for adjusting the length of the support structure by rotating adjustment links around a hinge shaft. This mechanism is designed to move two fixing plates apart or together, which in turn moves connected moving plates. Connection bars connect the fixing plates, with through-holes in the first fixing plate allowing passage of the connection bars and guiding their longitudinal movement. A length stopper controls the movement of the connection bar and the first fixing plate using a restraining lever and a pressurizing member.

An alternative design for restricting longitudinal movement uses a rotation stopper with a restraining dial, shaft body, shaft column, and shaft plate. The rotation stopper limits relative movement of the fixing plates by restraining the rotation of the hinge shaft.

The device includes a holder that allows angle adjustment through a link mechanism enabling horizontal motion while rotating opposite sides of the link member, thus adjusting the angle between the mounting plate and the base plate. A fixing unit maintains the connection rod at a predetermined value, which can be adjusted by the user for easy angle adjustment during use.

The drive module selectively couples to different hinges for wrist or elbow joint rehabilitation. The drive shaft has a polygonal shape in cross-section, and the scope of the patent is not limited to hexagonal shapes as illustrated in the figures. A gear restraining member prevents the drive module from being fastened to certain hinges when it is meshed with the rotary gear plate, thus preventing rotation of specific parts and potential failure of the drive module.

The device can interact with an app installed in a smart device, and includes a mounting position detecting part that automatically recognizes its installation position using magnets and a Hall sensor or short-range communication tags. The primary application of this invention is for rehabilitating patients' upper or lower limbs by providing a customizable and efficient exercise solution.","[{'document': 'WO 2018002266 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2019116779 A1'}, {'document': 'JP H09271496 A'}, {'document': 'JP 5283401 B2'}, {'document': 'KR 20090100579 A'}, {'document': 'KR 101764587 B1'}, {'document': 'KR 101904468 B1'}]","[{'document': 'KR 101163903'}, {'document': 'WO 2019116779 A1'}, {'document': 'JP H09271496 A'}]",[],WO2021096132,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent explicitly relates to a ""rehabilitation exercise device 1 for upper and lower limbs"", directly contributing to improving health and well-being.

This specialized glass is engineered to withstand the high temperatures (500°C - 700°C) and resist thermal deformation during lamp operation, a critical requirement due to the intense heat generated by these lamps.

The focus of research has been on alkaline earth aluminosilicate system glasses, which offer desirable properties such as high strain points (above 700°C), low coefficients of thermal expansion (42-55 x 10^-7/C°), and operable melting temperatures below 1550°C. The patent describes a unique combination of CaO, SrO, BaO, Al2O3, and SiO2 to achieve desired properties such as high strain point (>750°C), low coefficient of thermal expansion (42-44 x 10^-7/CO), low liquidus temperature (<1300°C), high viscosity at the liquidus (at least 40,000 poises or 4000 Pa.s), and a molar ratio of SrO:BaO between 2:1 to 1:2.

The glass composition is characterized by specific weight percentages on the oxide basis: 64-68% SiO2, 11-14% CaO, 16.5-18.5% Al2O3, and 2-6.5% SrO + BaO (0-4% SrO and 0-5% BaO). The patent also provides a process for producing the glass by compounding and melting appropriate components, followed by pouring the melt into steel moulds to form slabs.

The process involves continuous leaching and heating, which allows for the efficient dissolving of lignin and hydrolysis of hemicellulose, operating at lower temperatures (90-110°C) compared to traditional methods.

The key technical innovation is the recycling of the phenol-lignin phase after filtration, which can be reused for delignifying new batches of material until it becomes too concentrated and needs to be processed for separating useful pentoses and phenols. This process results in high-purity cellulose, usable pentoses, and phenols, with the latter being naturally recycled in the process and excess produced for future use.

The method offers several advantages over traditional methods, including high cellulose quality and purification yields, independence from starting reagents after the initial addition of phenol, full profitability from wood constituents, easy separation of key phases (cellulose, aqueous phase with high pentose concentration, and organic ligno-phenolic phase), and repeated recycling of the liquid phase for multiple delignification cycles.

The unpyrolyzed lignin can be further processed for producing carbonaceous residue, adsorbent carbon, fuel, and volatile substances. The patent also discusses the use of phenols in promoting the hydrolysis of hemicellulose component of lignocellulosic substances simultaneously with delignification, resulting in an unexpected and surprising effect that enhances the yield of pentoses.

The primary applications of this process include the production of biofuels, chemicals, and materials from waste biomass. The use of a variety of lignocellulosic wastes in both green and dry states makes this method versatile and adaptable to different sources of biomass. Examples provided in the patent demonstrate the effectiveness of the process using beech-wood sawdust, with the resulting sugar-rich aqueous phase containing pentoses and glucose, and the organic phase containing delignification phenol and partially degraded lignin.

The patent also describes the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for analyzing sugars resulting from hydrolysis in both the aqueous phase and pulp washing water fractions, improving dissolution of lignin and hydrolysis of pentosanes with better results obtained at 100°C compared to 90°C.

The proposed solutions revolve around the development of a novel bone fracture fixation plate made from high-strength fiber-reinforced polymers, such as laminated carbon-fiber reinforced polysulphone.

The unique feature of this plate is its ability to gradually decrease in rigidity over the healing period. This gradual reduction in rigidity can be achieved through various methods, including partial bonding with cyanoacrylate adhesive, heat and compression bonding, or application of thermoplastic resin particles. The plate's rigidity can initially exceed that of intact bone but will decrease to a level slightly beneath it when the bond between laminae fails, allowing for accelerated healing of fractures and reducing osteopenia caused by internal fixation.

The proposed solutions also involve creating plates with notched transverse structures or porous structures on conventional metal or alloy plates, causing the notches to extend or voids in the porous structure to enlarge with repeated loading, resulting in a gradual decrease in rigidity. All these innovations are designed for internal fixation of bone fractures in orthopedics, aiming to improve healing processes and reduce complications associated with traditional rigid fixation methods.

The non-metallic nature of the plates allows them to remain attached to the bone after healing is complete, eliminating the need for a second surgical operation for plate removal. The plates can be shaped to fit specific bones and may be used in pairs for additional rigidity when needed. The axial rigidity decreases significantly over the fracture healing period while torsional and bending rigidity remains relatively unchanged, offering advantages such as improved healing outcomes.","[{'document': 'EP 0052998 A'}, {'document': 'GB 2075346 A'}, {'document': 'GB 2146535 A'}]",[],[],,"['AT', 'BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'FR', 'GB', 'IT', 'LI', 'LU', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes ""a bone fracture fixation device"" which directly contributes to improving health and well-being by treating bone fractures.",Human Necessities,Medical & Healthcare,ED.

specifically targeting residual oil as the feedstock. The key innovation lies in pre-treating the residual oil using a thermal regenerative cracking (TRC) process before final catalytic cracking. This pretreatment aims to reduce heavy metallic contaminants, sulfur, and coke precursors from the feedstock, minimizing destructive effects on liquid hydrocarbon components.

The TRC process involves vaporizing the heavy hydrocarbon feedstock at high temperatures (566°C - 649°C or 1050°F - 1200°F) in a tubular thermal-pretreating reactor, along with hot particulate solids. The process reduces non-volatiles containing contaminants to coke products on the solids.

The pretreated gases are separated from the solids and can be directly delivered to a catalytic cracking reactor or stored for future use. The invention offers benefits such as efficient energy utilization, improved catalytic cracking, and reduced feed vaporization requirements when integrated with a catalytic cracking reactor.

The primary application of this invention is in the production of gasoline from residual oil through a more efficient and cleaner catalytic cracking process. The method aims to address the challenges associated with using heavier hydrocarbons, which typically contain higher levels of contaminants, as feedstock for catalytic cracking processes.

The patent also describes a solid-liquid separator design that efficiently removes solids from a gas stream, particularly useful in hydrocarbon pretreatment processes. The key technical innovation is the curvilinear arc shape of the static bed of solids within the separator, which minimizes erosion and allows for high inlet velocities up to 150 ft/sec (45.75 mls) and a wide range of dilute phase densities.

The separator's efficiency is optimized by adjusting the height H and the distance CL between the inlet and outlet, with preferred values being not greater than 4D; for CL and between 1.5 and 2.5 D for the distance between centerlines. The width W of the flow path is preferably between 0.75 and 1.25 times D. The separator's geometry must be essentially rectangular, with an optimum relationship between H and the U-bend in the gas flow, as efficiency increases as the flow path decreases and hence, residence time decreases.

The patent includes a reactor feeder and separator that are particularly well-suited for this process due to their ability to rapidly mix hydrocarbon feed and particulate solids, ensuring a homogeneous reaction phase in the reaction zone with a residence time below 1 second. The walls of the reactor are lined with an inner core of ceramic material.

The eluted solution is directly usable for radiolabeling reactions, eliminating the need for water elimination through evaporation.

The patent also describes methods for purifying [18F]fluoride obtained from the 18O(p,n)18F nuclear reaction using anion exchange cartridges. The cartridges are conditioned differently depending on their type (QMA light or PSA-HCO3), with various solutions and air purging steps to optimize the purification process.

The key technical innovation lies in the use of anion exchange cartridges for the purification and subsequent fluorination of various precursors, resulting in improved 18F-incorporation efficiency compared to previous methods. The primary application is in the field of radiochemistry and nuclear medicine, specifically for the production of radiopharmaceuticals used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.

Key technical innovations include optimizing conditioning procedures for QMA and PSA cartridges, investigating the effect of counterions on [18F]fluoride removal, and using cryptate in alternative eluent solutions for this process. The methods described aim to improve recovery, reduce overall volume necessary, and increase 18F-incorporation efficiency for various precursors.","[{'document': 'EP 1990310 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2008101305 A1'}, {'document': 'GATLEY ET AL: ""Rapid production and trapping of [<18>F]fluorotrimethylsilane, and its use in nucleophilic fluorine-18 labeling without an aqueous evaporation step"", APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OFRADIATION APPLICATIONS AND INSTRUMENTATION, PART A, PERGAMON PRESS LTD, GB, vol. 40, no. 6, 1 January 1989 (1989-01-01), pages 541-544, XP024706468, ISSN: 0883-2889, DOI: 10.1016/0883-2889(89)90143-3 [retrieved on 1989-01-01]'}, {'document': 'WILSON ET AL: ""Radiosynthesis and initial evaluation of [<18>F]-FEPPA for PET imaging of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors"", NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY, ELSEVIER, NY, US, vol. 35, no. 3, 17 March 2008 (2008-03-17) , pages 305-314, XP022537631, ISSN: 0969-8051, DOI: 10.1016/J.NUCMEDBIO.2007.12.009'}, {'document': 'N.

system designed primarily for identifying and classifying subpopulations within mixtures of particles, with a specific focus on sperm cells for applications in animal reproduction. The key technical innovation involves a self-calibrating identification technique that continuously refines the definition of subpopulations based on real-time data obtained from additional particles in the mixture. This method identifies critical values for each characteristic, co-locates these critical values in a feature space, and determines discrimination values from the co-located critical values.

The system is equipped with a sample delivery apparatus, cytometer, control apparatus, and sorting apparatus. The cytometry apparatus uses a laser to illuminate and analyze individual cells based on their DNA content. The sorting operation is carried out by analyzing digitized output signals from the flow cytometry apparatus, classifying events based on discrimination values, and providing instructions to the sorting apparatus.

The patent also presents methods for analyzing event data sets in the (intensity, area) coordinate space to identify male and female peaks, with applications in DNA sequencing. Key technical innovations include smoothing the histogram, using a least-squares polynomial curve-fitting algorithm, and adjusting for electronic drift.

The patent further describes methods for optimizing the gating of sperm cells based on their DNA content, specifically discriminating between X-chromosome and Y-chromosome bearing sperm cells. Key technical innovations include a least-squares polygon fitting algorithm to determine the center of each peak in the histogram, using the Newton-Raphson algorithm for high precision peak centering, calculating the Peak-to-Trough (P2T) ratio and comparing it to a threshold for quality control, finding the highest peak in an 'area' histogram to determine y-coordinate values for each peak, adjusting peak intensity coordinates and trough intensity for drift in electronics over time, and calculating gate vertices based on the peaks and trough with an adjustable encroachment percentage for defining the gate area.

The primary application of this system is in assisted reproductive technology (ART) for sex selection, particularly in dairy applications to produce female offspring. The method can be applied to various fields requiring sexed sperm cells for research or assisted reproductive technology.","[{'document': 'WO 2018151680 A1'}, {'document': 'MEHRNOUSH MALEK ET AL: ""flowDensity: reproducing manual gating of flow cytometry data by automated density-based cell population identification"", BIOINFORMATICS., vol. 31, no. 4, 16 October 2014 (2014-10-16), GB, pages 606 - 607, XP055537251, ISSN: 1367-4803, DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu677'}, {'document': 'PEDREIRA CARLOS E ET AL: ""Overview of clinical flow cytometry data analysis: recent advances and future challenges"", TRENDS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY, ELSEVIER PUBLICATIONS, CAMBRIDGE, GB, vol. 31, no. 7, 5 June 2013 (2013-06-05), pages 415 - 425, XP028571316, ISSN: 0167-7799, DOI: 10.1016/J.TIBTECH.2013.04.008'}]","[{'document': 'US 8502148 B'}, {'document': 'US 9835552 B'}, {'document': 'US 9683922 B'}, {'document': 'US 4896966 A'}, {'document': 'US 4896967 A'}, {'document': 'US 9588100 B'}, {'document': 'US 10069027 B'}, {'document': 'MEHRNOUSH MALEK et al. flowDensity: reproducing manual gating of flow cytometry data by automated density-based cell population identification Bioinformatics 20140000 31 4 606 607'}, {'document': 'FARRELL et al.

This innovative ""powder-in-tube"" process, termed PM-Wire, allows for the mass production of permanent magnets in various shapes such as cylindrical, rectangular prism, square prism, and pie-shaped.

The method involves compressing and heating powdered magnetic metals within the tube, followed by sintering, annealing, machining, and magnetizing to produce robust, cost-effective permanent magnets. The process enables the creation of complex magnetic arrays like Halbach arrays, which are mechanically robust and easier to assemble compared to conventional permanent magnets.

The invention offers several advantages over traditional manufacturing methods, including efficiency, fewer steps involved, and the ability to create longer magnets for easier construction of complex arrays.

This innovative material is designed to foster bone formation at specific sites in mammals, making it suitable for various medical applications such as limb salvage, fracture treatment, scoliosis correction, joint prosthesis, dental procedures, and dental implants.

The key technical innovation lies in the combination of an artificial bone-supporting material (AW-glass ceramic) with a natural osteogenesis promoting substance that enhances bone bonding. The method for preparing this material involves extracting the osteogenesis promoting substance from demineralized bone powder using guanidine hydrochloric acid, followed by gel filtration and lyophilization.

The primary application of this invention is in surgery or orthopedics for various bone-related procedures, as well as in dentistry or oral surgery for dental implants and bone regeneration. The material's unique property allows it to form a strong bond between the natural bone and the artificial bone, thereby providing both functional and structural support.

The patent describes a method for preparing demineralized bone powder from neonatal calf bones, which is then used to promote osteogenesis (bone growth) in artificial bones. The primary method for preparing the demineralized bone powder includes cutting, crushing, washing, organic solvent treatment, pulverization, demineralization with hydrochloric acid or other chemicals, washing again, and drying.

The osteogenesis promoting substance is prepared by extracting it from the demineralized bone powder using guanidine hydrochloride acid and gel filtration. This substance is then applied or incorporated into the artificial bone, which can be made of metal, ceramic, high polymer, protein materials, or composite materials.

The artificial bone with the osteogenesis promoting substance is designed to release the substance in situ into the living tissue of the defective bone portion when transplanted. The surface of the artificial bone may be porous to facilitate the application or incorporation of the substance.

The primary applications of this invention are in orthopedics, specifically for repairing bone deficient portions. The osteogenesis promoting substance can be applied or incorporated into the artificial bone and released in situ to promote bone bonding and integration with the host's natural bone. The effective amount of the substance is about 0.1 to 1.5 g/cm², preferably about 0.3 to 0.5 g/cm².

An example provided in the patent involves using A-W glass ceramic and demineralized rabbit bone powder for bone grafting in rabbits. The results showed successful osteogenesis and integration of the artificial bone with the host's natural bone, demonstrating the effectiveness of this technology. The patent also highlights an innovation by Nakamura et al., focusing on the use of A-W glass ceramic plates with calcified bone powder for enhancing bone-implant integration. This method is found to be more effective than using plain ceramic plates, as demonstrated by force required for separation tests in orthopedic surgery applications such as fixing fractures or replacing damaged bones with a stronger, more durable implant.","[{'document': 'EP 0082621 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0182483 A'}, {'document': 'FR 2564732 A'}, {'document': 'GB 2176192 A'}, {'document': 'US 4563489 A'}, {'document': 'US 4596574 A'}, {'document': 'US 4627982 A'}]",[],[],,"['AT', 'BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'ES', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'IT', 'LI', 'LU', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent explicitly focuses on ""bone repairing material"" and ""inducing bone formation"", directly contributing to improved health outcomes.

with heating and cooling the battery pack. This system consists of two subsystems: one for managing the High-Voltage System (HVS) waste heat and another for the HVAC system.

The HVS thermal management system includes a heat sink, a heat exchanger, and a waste heat utilization branch containing a water pump and a high-voltage system cooling branch passing through the vehicle. The heat exchanger's cooling liquid outlet communicates with the waste heat utilization branch, which can optionally communicate directly or indirectly (through the heat sink) with the heat exchanger's cooling liquid inlet.

The compressor's outlet communicates with the direct-cooling device of the battery pack, while the refrigerant inlet of the heat exchanger communicates with the second port of the direct-cooling device via a first throttle branch.

The system is designed to heat the battery pack when necessary, either by utilizing waste heat from the HVS or by combining it with external environment energy. This improves the energy utilization of the vehicle and reduces the need for heating the battery pack with an air conditioner, thereby improving the heating energy efficiency of the air conditioner system for the passenger compartment.

The patent also includes a bi-directional expansion assembly that allows for heating and cooling of both the passenger compartment and the battery pack using the same branch, reducing the need for additional pipelines. The assembly consists of a bi-directional expansion valve, two check valves, and a heat exchanger.

Additionally, the patent suggests using a plate heat exchanger for increased heat exchange efficiency and compact structure. To enhance battery pack heating, the patent proposes a self-heating device that includes a controller, motor electric control circuits, and energy storage modules or an electric heating film overlaid on the battery module.

The system can be used in various types of electric vehicles, including pure electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles. The patent's key innovation is the use of a direct-cooling device that eliminates the need for additional heat exchangers and pipelines, reducing cost and simplifying pipeline arrangements, thereby improving overall vehicle efficiency, longevity, and safety.","[{'document': 'WO 2019138731 A1'}, {'document': 'CN 108859654 A'}, {'document': 'CN 109968940 A'}, {'document': 'CN 205970883 U'}, {'document': 'CN 208931069 U'}, {'document': 'CN 208931069 U'}, {'document': 'CN 213920593 U'}, {'document': 'CN 213920594 U'}, {'document': 'JP 2012111251 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2012214175 A'}, {'document': 'KR 20140091187 A'}, {'document': 'US 2014190203 A1'}, {'document': 'US 9786964 B2'}]",[{'document': 'CN 109968940 A'}],[],WO2022057936,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],"7,9","– Goal 7: The patent describes a ""vehicle thermal management system and electric vehicle"", which directly relates to improving energy efficiency in transportation.

The TPS employs protection devices such as fire protection doors, visual alarms, emergency exit lightings, and door control systems that can be controlled by the system's controller based on the threat's location and calculated path. The key innovation is the system's ability to dynamically guide the movement of threats within the structure using an algorithm that takes into account the temporal positions of people and the threat itself.

The TSS can either function independently or cooperate with existing systems like a Fire Safety System (FSS). The algorithm used by the controller can be trained using machine learning techniques, and it is adaptable to specific structures based on their layout plans and predefined scenarios.

The system aims to minimize risks for occupants by dynamically activating or deactivating protection devices to guide threats along a calculated path that avoids populated areas. It also provides real-time information about the threat's position and the nearest safe exit through a loudspeaker system. The controller of the TSS is installed in a Fire Control Panel (FCP) and controls the protection devices via activation electrical circuits of the FSS.

It is designed to meet test protocols for temporary traffic barriers and offers advantages over traditional barriers by protecting workers from vehicles while allowing them to work alongside the moving barrier. The modular design allows for flexible positioning and navigation over various road conditions, with key technical innovations including position sensors, height sensors, coupling elements with a locking mechanism, and a control unit that manages drives and receives data from sensors.

The self-driving feature enables more efficient movement of the barrier, requiring fewer modules. Primary applications include roads with bends and low-speed traffic areas like car parks. The patent also includes methods for setting up and removing the barrier system, allowing it to be combined with fixed or stationary barriers as part of a barrier assembly. Key technical innovations include bars extending through the barrier module body serving as mounting points for position sensors, maintaining sensor positions irrespective of deformations or bending in the barrier.

In summary, this patent describes an innovative mobile traffic barrier system consisting of interconnected modules that can move horizontally and adjust their height along their length, providing flexible positioning and navigation over various road conditions. The self-driving feature, modular design, lift mechanism, independently drivable sets of wheels or tracks, and self-braking drives are the primary technical innovations, aiming to improve traffic management, road safety, and accident prevention.","[{'document': 'WO 2017118475 A1'}, {'document': 'AU 2014265099 B2'}, {'document': 'DE 8915625 U1'}, {'document': 'FR 2692295 A1'}, {'document': 'NL 9001524 A'}]","[{'document': 'US 20190301117 A1'}, {'document': 'AU 2014265099'}, {'document': 'WO 2017118475 A'}, {'document': 'NL 9001524'}, {'document': 'NL 1006481'}]",[],WO2022098240,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],"3,9","– Goal 3: The patent explicitly aims to protect ""workers and/or equipment from errant vehicles"", contributing to reducing deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.

The key innovation lies in optimizing alloy compositions by combining multiple alloying elements such as lithium, aluminum, zinc, yttrium, rare earth metals (like neodymium, yttrium, zirconium, zinc, calcium, and beryllium), and others to achieve desired properties while maintaining good plasticity.

The primary application of these alloys is in the construction of biodegradable or bioresorbable stents for coronary and peripheral arteries. The advantage of using these magnesium alloy-based stents is that they gradually dissolve in vivo, avoiding the occurrence of thrombosis formation after their medical function has been executed.

The patent text also mentions various compositions of Mg-RE alloys to increase their characteristics and improve their corrosion stability, such as U.S. Patent 2003/0129074's high temperature resistant magnesium alloy containing neodymium, yttrium, zirconium, zinc, calcium, and beryllium. The corrosion stability of these alloys is inversely related to the Fe, Ni, and Cu impurity levels.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in using magnesium alloys as materials for biodegradable stents due to their potential advantages over organic polymers. However, the WE43 alloy, while providing a good combination of corrosion stability and plasticity for magnesium alloys, is not optimal as a constructional material for manufacturing biosoluble stents due to insufficient plasticity and corrosion stability in vivo.

To address this issue, the patent describes a new magnesium alloy with improved strength, plasticity, and corrosion resistance. The alloy consists of indium (0.1-4.0%), scandium (0.1-15.0%), yttrium (0.1-3.0%), rare earth metals other than Scandium, Gadolinium, or Yttrium (0.1-3.0%), zirconium (0.1-0.7%), and ultrapure magnesium (99.98% or higher). The alloy can also contain Gallium instead of Indium, Gadolinium instead of Scandium, or Hafnium/Titan instead of Zirconium.

The alloy has an ultra-fine grain structure with a size less than 3 microns and does not contain harmful elements for living organisms in appreciable quantities. The alloy offers high formability, yield stress, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, as well as improved corrosion resistance compared to existing alloys like WE43. Indium is found to significantly contribute to the alloy's properties due to its ability to refine grains during crystallization and provide high deformability at room temperature without fracture.

The primary applications for this alloy are in medical devices that come into contact with the body, such as screws, bolts, plates, stents, spiral coils, markers, catheters, etc. The alloy provides fine formability, excellent corrosion resistance in sodium chloride solution, and high heat resistance among known magnesium-based alloys.

The patent describes two innovative magnesium alloys, each containing specific amounts of indium, scandium, yttrium, rare earth, and zirconium (with impurities strictly controlled). The alloys are produced through a unique process involving direct fusion in a high-purity argon atmosphere, followed by various stages of heating, cooling, extrusion, equal-channel angular extrusion, and annealing.

The primary technical innovation lies in the production method and the specific composition of these alloys. The first alloy, after annealing, exhibits excellent mechanical properties (YS=215 MPa, UTS=290 MPa, elongation=25%) and a low corrosion rate (1.1 mg/cm²/day) compared to common industrial magnesium alloys.

The second alloy demonstrates good deformability, strength (YS=190 MPa, UTS=275 MPa, elongation=29%), and a moderate corrosion rate (1.8 mg/cm²/day) when tested in a sodium chloride solution.

The primary applications for these alloys would be in industries requiring materials with both high strength and good corrosion resistance, such as the automotive, aerospace, and electronics sectors.","[{'document': 'PENG ET AL: ""Microstructures and tensile properties of Mg-8Gd-0.6Zr-xNd-yY (x+y=3, mass%) alloys"" MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A: STRUCTURAL MATERIALS: PROPERTIES, MICROSTRUCTURE & PROCESSING, LAUSANNE, CH, vol. 433, no. 1-2, 15 October 2006 (2006-10-15), pages 133-138, XP005623386 ISSN: 0921-5093'}]","[{'document': 'US 20056838049 A'}, {'document': 'US 19915059390 A'}, {'document': 'JP 19979241778 B'}, {'document': 'US 19935238646 A'}, {'document': 'US 20050129564 A'}, {'document': 'US 20026395224 A'}, {'document': 'US 20050095166 A'}, {'document': 'US 20016193817 A'}, {'document': 'US 20030129074 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2000282165 A'}, {'document': 'US 20050266041 A'}, {'document': 'DE 200210128100'}, {'document': 'US 20040241036 A'}, {'document': 'US 20040098108 A'}, {'document': 'EP 20041419793 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2004043474 A'}, {'document': 'EP 20051562565 A'}, {'document': 'US 20060052864 A'}, {'document': 'EP 20061632255 A'}, {'document': 'US 20060246107 A'}, {'document': 'DE 10253634 20021113'}, {'document': 'US 20060052863 A'}, {'document': 'US 4591506 A'}, {'document': 'US 4182754 A'}, {'document': 'RU 283589'}, {'document': 'RU 569638'}, {'document': 'Peng et al.

The key technical innovation involves the use of a V-shaped reaction chamber with an upwardly extending wall that defines a cavity with a larger upper portion than the lower portion, optimizing product uniformity and improving hydrogen production efficiency.

The system consists of three chambers: gasification, combustion, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), connected by channels to facilitate material flow between them. The CVD chamber is designed to widen towards the top and features protrusions on its internal surface that promote efficient circulation and product collection.

The system operates without intermediate cooling and can transfer heat from the combustion chamber to the gasification chamber for increased efficiency. Various catalyst supports, such as activated carbon-based materials, metal carbides, and carbon nano-tubes, are used to enhance hydrogen production efficiency. Waste heat from various installations like solar/thermal collection, gasification, combustion, hydro-cracking, or steam reforming of fossil fuels is utilized for heating.

This technology involves genetically modifying Programmed Death Protein 1 (PD-1), a protein known for its role in immune tolerance, particularly in the immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction.

The modification creates a fusion protein that combines a negative signal domain of PD-1 with a positive signal domain, effectively converting negative signals into positive ones to enhance immune response. The modified T cells express both the modified PD-1 and CAR, which are specific for various tumor antigens such as HER2, CD19, CD20, etc., and can be delivered in a pharmaceutical composition to treat cancer in human patients.

The modification reduces immune tolerance by either truncating or introducing point mutations that disrupt the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1. Additionally, the use of soluble receptors, including an extracellular domain of PD-1, is disclosed for treating and inhibiting cancer by binding and disrupting PD-1 signaling in cancer cells or inhibiting PD-1 binding to PD-L1.

The primary focus of this technology is on CD19+ tumor cells that express PD-L1. The engineered T cells can potentially reduce immune tolerance induced by PD-L1, thereby eliminating these tumor cells in vivo in a patient. This patent covers a wide range of co-stimulatory ligands and molecules, particularly between antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells, to enhance T cell response such as proliferation, activation, and differentiation.

The key technical innovation lies in the use of specific co-stimulatory ligands and molecules on APCs that bind cognate co-stimulatory molecules on T cells, thereby enhancing T cell response. The patent describes a novel method for enhancing the efficacy of CAR-T cells in cancer treatment by genetically modifying immune cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that includes an antibody recognition domain and either a modified or wild-type T cell receptor intracellular domain, along with a truncated PD-1. This modification reduces the sensitivity of PD-1 to PD-L1, thereby improving the antitumor efficacy of the modified CAR-T cells compared to unmodified ones when exposed to PD-L1.

The techniques described in this patent have potential applications beyond cancer treatment, including immune deficiencies, autoimmune disease, and obesity.

The main innovation lies in the use of deflecting rollers mounted on one column element, connected to a belt attached to the carriage and running over a belt attachment on the other column element. These deflecting rollers function as both deflection elements and belt tension sensors, with a spring-loaded belt tension sensing means on the belt attachment that exerts a pulling force on the belt.

In case of insufficient belt tension or obstruction during downward movement, the driving motor control system stops the motor to prevent further motion, ensuring safety and reliability, which are crucial factors in patient lifting devices. The patent offers three designs for the belt tension sensing mechanism: one using deflecting rollers that serve as both deflection elements and belt tension sensors, activating a microswitch when the right-hand belt is broken; another employing two deflecting rollers between the belt attachments with a compression spring actuating a displaceable shaft to interrupt the motor drive when the belt breaks or motion stops; and lastly, a design featuring a microswitch with a roller that presses against the belt, discontinuing the motor drive if the belt breaks or the carriage is stopped in its downward motion.

In summary, this patent describes a safety mechanism for a lifting appliance, focusing on belt tension sensing methods to stop the driving motor in case of insufficient belt tension or obstruction. The designs can use compression springs or other yieldable actuating means like tension springs to produce the desired load on the sensing means. The primary application is in lifting appliances where maintaining proper belt tension is crucial for safe operation.","[{'document': 'EP 0267888 A'}, {'document': 'DE 3602105 A'}, {'document': 'SE 8604809 A'}]",[],[],,"['AT', 'BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'DK', 'ES', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'IT', 'LI', 'LU', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""lifting appliance, especially for a patient lifting device"", which supports health by facilitating patient care and mobility.

apparatuses for determining visual parameters of an individual's eyes, primarily focusing on vision research, ophthalmology, and the development of assistive technologies for those with visual impairments. Key features include the use of a continuous target-tracking task with a Kalman filter model, analysis of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) to measure contrast sensitivity function, investigating the effect of refractive error on OKN, studying the relationship between OKN and saccades, examining the suppression of optokinesis during smooth pursuit eye movements, exploring improved visual sensitivity during smooth pursuit eye movements, developing a computerized OKN suppression test for measuring visual acuity, and presenting two moving visual stimuli to evaluate visual performance.

The patent introduces an AI-based system that generates a statistical model for analyzing visual parameters by training on large amounts of data, including eye-tracking data, stimulus data about visual stimuli locations, and known visual parameter data. The goal is to minimize the deviation between preliminary data and known data by adjusting the machine learning algorithm.

A unique device is described that utilizes a smartphone's cameras for head tracking and eye movement analysis to determine visual parameters of a person's eyes. This device allows for self-performed visual parameter testing without the need for an ophthalmologist or optometry specialist. The method involves using dynamic visual stimuli, including pursuit stimuli, to make the measurement procedure more enjoyable and independent from external factors affecting eye movement.

The patent presents a system that utilizes optokinetic nystagmus stimuli to track and analyze a person's eye movements. The system displays various visual patterns like Gabor patch, noise patch, stripe pattern, or pursuit stimuli (e.g., circles, grids) on a screen (smartphone or VR headset), using an eye-tracking device to monitor the resulting eye movement. The optokinetic nystagmus stimulus consists of slow and quick phases, while the pursuit stimulus causes conscious pursuit eye movements. The system's spatial location for the pursuit stimulus is time-varying, causing it to move across the person's field of view.

The patent also presents a computer-implemented method that displays two different visual stimuli simultaneously, tracks the resulting eye movement, and determines the visual parameters based on the tracking data. This method can record additional data like distance between the eye and screen, gaze position, head movement, and may involve varying visual parameters over time.

The system can be used in various applications such as vision research, eye-tracking systems, or virtual reality applications. The primary method involves displaying a first visual stimulus at a specific location, tracking the person's gaze position, and determining distance, line of sight, and other relevant data based on the tracked gaze position and head movement. This technology could have applications in healthcare, gaming, and advertising industries.","[{'document': 'EP 3730037 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2018006013 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2022015227 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2012019779 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2012105609 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2020214559 A1'}, {'document': 'US 10945599 B1'}]","[{'document': 'US 20170354369 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2018006013 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2022015227 A1'}, {'document': 'US 20200214559 A'}, {'document': 'US 10945599 B1'}, {'document': 'US 2012105609 A1'}, {'document': 'BONNEN, K.

The key technical innovation is the use of rice hulls, rich in amorphous silica, to reduce crystal formation and clumping in urea-based fertilizers during storage, thereby improving their performance and reducing loss of active ingredients like herbicides.

The primary application of this invention is for promoting plant growth by adding the fertilizer composition to plants, soil, or as a soil amendment or additive. The rice hulls make up 1-50% by weight of the granules and are comminuted to a specific size range (20-70 SGN). The urea-based fertilizer can have a urea to formaldehyde ratio of about 1.5:1 to 8:1.

The composition may include various macronutrients, micronutrients, and herbicides like dicamba, 2,4-D, MCPP-P, and other fertilizer components such as mono-ammonium phosphate or potassium chloride. The granules can be made through a process that involves spraying molten urea-containing fertilizer resin onto rice hulls and forming a granule.

The reduced crystal aspect ratio and number of urea crystals in the fertilizer may also help reduce odor during storage, making it more suitable for use in residential areas. The patent describes methods for producing these compositions using various techniques such as spraying, adhesion, extrusion, or impregnation.

The primary method of weed control improvement is the reduction of crystal area and crystals counted due to the addition of ground rice hulls, which helps prevent the development of crystal bridges that cause product caking. This lower crystal growth is achieved by formulating the methylene urea resin with a urea to formaldehyde ratio of 4:1 to 8:1 and granulating the mixture at specific temperatures in a rotating drum.

The rice hull-based fertilizer composition also provides better weed control, controlling Dandelions at a rate of 1.6 - 3.0 times greater than traditional urea-based fertilizers and White clover at a rate of 1.3 - 3.4 times greater. Additionally, the lower urea crystal growth protects any surface-applied active ingredients by preventing crystals from covering the particle surface, thereby improving active ingredient effectiveness and product performance.

The patent also mentions an odor analysis study that shows improved odor characteristics for the rice hull-based fertilizer composition compared to traditional urea-based fertilizers. The improved odor is attributed to the incorporation of ground rice hulls into the formulation.

In summary, this patent presents a novel fertilizer composition with rice hulls that improves weed control, reduces crystal growth, and offers better active ingredient effectiveness and product performance compared to traditional urea-based fertilizers. The improved odor characteristics are an added benefit of the rice hull-based formulation. This patent also describes a method for measuring and comparing the odor levels of various products using olfactometry analysis.","[{'document': 'WO 2014144724 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2008016701 A2'}, {'document': 'CN 101366356 A'}, {'document': 'CN 101486618 A'}, {'document': 'CN 102476968 A'}, {'document': 'CN 103664381 A'}, {'document': 'US 3041159 A'}, {'document': 'US 3852055 A'}, {'document': 'US 6458747 B1'}, {'document': 'US 7776125 B2'}]","[{'document': 'US 3076700 A'}, {'document': 'US 3231363 A'}, {'document': 'US 3223518 A'}, {'document': 'US 4025329 A'}, {'document': 'US 5102440 A'}, {'document': 'US 6039781 A'}, {'document': 'US 7776125 B'}, {'document': 'WO 2012129847 A'}, {'document': 'US 3041159 A'}, {'document': 'US 3325276 A'}, {'document': 'US 3558299 A'}, {'document': 'US 3852055 A'}, {'document': 'US 7108732 B'}, {'document': 'US 8492444 B'}, {'document': 'CN 103664381 A'}, {'document': 'CN 102476968 A'}, {'document': 'US 6458747 B1'}, {'document': 'WO 2014144724 A'}, {'document': 'CN 101486618 A'}, {'document': 'US 6254655 B'}, {'document': 'US 8288320 B'}, {'document': 'DAVEY et al.

The innovation lies in the use of anionic polymers, prepared through free-radical polymerization of specific ratios of methacrylic acid and either methylmethacrylate or ethylacrylate. These polymers form a matrix to create an amorphous dispersion that provides sustained release profiles over 12 or 24 hours, ensuring consistent bioavailability and serum levels of A2A receptor antagonists (Formula I).

The method involves hot melt extrusion (HME) to produce a dispersion or solution of Formula I in a polymer matrix, which can then be incorporated into oral dosage forms such as tablets or capsules. The primary application is in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, where sustained-release formulations are thought to provide therapeutic benefits due to maintaining therapeutic serum levels for an extended period.

A clinical study comparing the pharmacokinetics (PK) of four different formulations of Compound IA (preladenant), including immediate release, controlled release for 12 hours, controlled release for 24 hours, and a bi-layer IR/CR tablet, was conducted. The objective was to evaluate the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of these formulations. The results showed that the controlled-release formulations offer improved pharmacokinetics, specifically increased trough levels and therapeutic exposure over a 12 or 24 hour period compared to immediate release formulations. The bi-layer tablet design was found to provide satisfactory serum levels for therapeutic use, with no significant influence of tablet hardness on the dissolution profile from the controlled-release tablets.

In summary, this patent presents a groundbreaking technology for developing controlled-release dispersions using anionic polymers, which can be used to treat movement disorders associated with Parkinson's disease. The technology offers improved pharmacokinetics and sustained drug levels, providing therapeutic benefits over traditional immediate release formulations.","[{'document': 'WO 2014072881 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2013067199 A2'}, {'document': 'WO 2013067199 A2'}, {'document': ""HARRIS ET AL.: 'Potent and selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonists: [1,2,4]-triazolo[4,3- c]pyrimidin-3-ones' BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS vol. 21, 2011, pages 2497 - 2501, XP055340891""}]","[{'document': 'WO 9501356 A'}, {'document': 'US 5565460 A'}, {'document': 'WO 9705138 A'}, {'document': 'WO 9852568 A'}, {'document': 'US 6630475 B Neustadt'}, {'document': 'US 8389532 B Boyle'}, {'document': 'WO 2009129300 A 20091022'}, {'document': 'US 4801460 A Goertz'}, {'document': 'WO 2013056108 A 20130418'}, {'document': 'FORD Pharm Acta Helv 19860000 61 69 88'}, {'document': 'FRIESEN et al.

vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The primary innovation lies in combining a variable magnification (zoom) lens with one or more indexible masks to achieve a smoother reprofiling of the optically used region of the cornea during surgical treatment. This combination allows for controlled variation in the area of the cornea that is irradiated and a corresponding controlled variation in the cumulative ablative flux delivered to different areas, resulting in more accurate and smooth changes in corneal curvature profile.

The system includes a stationary laser device that projects a beam onto a patient's eye. A zoom lens with a reversible motor drive is used for varying the size of the laser spot at the eye, an adjustable iris for controlling the progression of outer-diameter limitation for each zone of the successive indexible apertures, three selectively indexable aperture discs (for hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatism correction), and a shutter. The system is designed to use an argon-fluoride laser emitting at 193 nanometers.

The key technical innovation lies in the use of a zoom lens in conjunction with an apertured mask to reduce the step size of ablation during eye surgery by at least an order of magnitude compared to prior art methods. The system's ability to control spot size precisely allows for more accurate and potentially less invasive vision correction procedures.

The patent also discusses the use of the invention for sculpting in depth to reproduce original curvature or remove scars from the cornea, making it applicable for various sculpturing procedures, including myopia correction and preparation for corneal transplants. The system's coordinated control enables more uniform increments of ablated radius throughout the entire optically corrected area, reducing the range within which magnification varies during a given procedure, thereby promoting more precise surgeries.","[{'document': 'EP 0207648 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0218427 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0224322 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0257836 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0274205 A'}, {'document': 'DE 2747618 A'}, {'document': 'DE 3414986 A'}]",[],[],,"['AT', 'BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'ES', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'IT', 'LI', 'LU', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes an ""apparatus for performing ophthalmological surgery by selective ablation of the optically used region of the anterior surface of the cornea with penetration into the stroma to achieve a volumetric removal of corneal tissue providing for corneal curvature correction"", which directly contributes to improving health and well-being by addressing vision correction.

RBF-P, derived from an epidermal portion of rice through a unique production process. The process involves extracting the epidermal portion with an alkaline solution, followed by precipitation and acidification to obtain RBF-P. This substance can be further fractionated into two active constituents: RBF-PM (a specific protein) and RBF-X (a combination of fatty acids and a hexane-insoluble substance). Both RBF-PM and the combined action of RBF-H and fatty acids exhibit suppressive effects on solid cancers in mice.

The patent also presents a method for obtaining RBF-PM from RBF-P, involving dissolving RBF-P in methanol, filtering out the insolubles, and drying the remaining methanol-insoluble substance. RBF-PM has been found to suppress tumor metastasis in mice.

The extraction and purification processes are designed to optimize yield and activity of RBF-P and RBF-PM, with factors such as temperature, time, base concentration, and solvent amount having significant impacts on these outcomes. The process is simpler compared to existing methods for obtaining antitumor substances from rice bran or its epidermal portion.

means comprise a fork 37, the prongs 38 of which form respective pins capable of engaging in the notches when the slider is in the first nonoperative position.",,"This patent describes a novel medical device designed to facilitate the introduction of catheters into blood vessels, addressing the limitations of previous devices regarding spatial requirements and safety concerns. The device's primary innovation is a slider mechanism that ensures operator safety during catheterization procedures by preventing accidental needle movement.

The device consists of a tubular body with a single chamber, a retractable needle, and a slider for controlling the needle's movement. The needle is located on the opposite side of the slider from the longitudinal axis of the tubular body, reducing its spatial requirement during operation.

The slider mechanism features a snap coupling system that secures the slider in two non-operative positions: a removable locking means for temporary holding and an irreversible locking means for secure storage after use. The slider can be moved along the slot towards an operative position where it can be locked with a syringe attached for blood verification purposes.

The device's unique configuration allows for minimal needle inclination during insertion, easy movement back into a non-operative position to prevent accidental movements, and the ability to leave the guide wire in place for catheter insertion after use. This design aims to significantly increase the safety of the device before, during, and after its use, making it easier for operators to handle and reducing potential risks associated with traditional catheterization procedures.","[{'document': 'WO 2010089727 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 02066093 A2'}, {'document': 'WO 2008137956 A2'}, {'document': 'US 2009069751 A1'}]","[{'document': 'WO 0178595 A'}, {'document': 'WO 02066093 A'}]",[],WO2012119939,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes ""a medical device for introducing a catheter into a blood vessel"", which directly contributes to ensuring access to quality essential health-care services.",Human Necessities,Other Human Necessities,Leader Medica S.r.l.,IT,1,"CERON, Mauro; MINOZZI, Roberto",IT,2,

The key technical innovation involves inactivating the clpB gene in Francisella tularensis to potentially attenuate its virulence, which may also have other inactivated genes such as capB, wbtC, ggt, fupA, or any combination thereof for additional attenuation or prevention of reversion.

The primary application of these mutants is for the development of an anti-Francisella vaccine composition. The invention includes a method of conferring immunity against F. tularensis by administering the mutant strain or a composition comprising such a mutant, either intradermally, subcutaneously, orally, or by inhalation to animals or humans. Boosting (a second administration) subsequent to the first administration is also included in the method.

The invention has been demonstrated through experiments showing that a mutant strain of F. tularensis SCHU S4 with a disrupted clpB gene is less virulent and more effective than LVS, an empirically attenuated type B strain of F. tularensis, in protecting mice against aerosol challenge with wild-type bacteria.

The patent aims to address the lack of an FDA-approved vaccine for general use that can provide prophylactic protection against respiratory tularaemia caused by Francisella tularensis. The mutant strain SCHU S4ΔclpB is shown to be less virulent than LVS and provides better protection against aerosol challenge with wild-type bacteria in both BALB/c and C3H/HeN mice when administered orally or intradermally.

The patent also mentions the potential use of live-attenuated strains of F. tularensis as vaccines, which are genetically modified to express antigens from other pathogens or toxins to broaden the immune response and provide cross-protection against multiple strains of F. tularensis.

In summary, this patent focuses on the development of potential oral and intranasal vaccines against tularemia using mutant strains of F. tularensis, specifically SCHU S4ΔclpB, which demonstrated better protection compared to LVS in mice and showed promise for further development as effective vaccines. The patent describes a method for developing an intranasal vaccine to protect against Francisella tularensis biovar A infections, aiming to broaden immune response and provide cross-protection, with potential applications in human and animal vaccination against tularemia.","[{'document': 'CA 2606673 A1'}, {'document': 'CA 2606673 A1'}, {'document': 'CONLAN J W ET AL: ""Differential ability of novel attenuated targeted deletion mutants of Francisella tularensis subspecies tularensis strain SCHU S4 to protect mice against aerosol challenge with virulent bacteria: Effects of host background and route of immunization"", VACCINE, ELSEVIER LTD, GB, vol. 28, no. 7, 17 February 2010 (2010-02-17), pages 1824-1831, XP026884519, ISSN: 0264-410X, DOI: 10.1016/J.VACCINE.2009.12.001 [retrieved on 2009-12-16]'}, {'document': 'KARIN L.

The primary innovation involves creating PEGylated liposomes, which are sterically stabilized liposomes with extended blood circulation time due to a surface coating of hydrophilic polymer chains (PEG). These liposomes can contain high concentrations of non-radioactive iodinated contrast-enhancing agents and are suitable for whole-body imaging or blood pool imaging.

The improved properties of this agent include slower clearance from the body, reduced extravasation, lower renal toxicity, and targeted delivery to specific areas of the body. The patent provides methods for preparing these liposomes and their use in X-ray imaging techniques.

These targeted PEGylated liposomes can be further modified by incorporating ligands such as antibodies or fragments on their surface, making them ""targeted liposomes."" The patent describes methods for attaching antibody molecules to the liposome surface using different modified lipids and spacer chains.

The primary applications of these targeted PEGylated liposomes are in drug delivery systems, as they can be designed to specifically bind or attach to certain cells or tissues, potentially improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects. Additionally, the patent describes methods for loading the liposomes with contrast-enhancing agents for use in imaging applications.

The patent introduces active or remote loading methods for introducing contrast-enhancing agents into already formed liposomes. This is achieved by establishing an ion gradient between the inside and outside of the liposomes, allowing the contrast-enhancing agents to move into the liposomes based on a concentration or ion gradient.

The main application of these methods is in medical imaging, where the contrast-enhancing agents are used to improve the visibility of specific tissues or structures during diagnostic procedures such as MRI or CT scans. The concentrated and efficiently loaded liposomes could potentially lead to improved image quality and reduced costs associated with the use of contrast agents.

The patent describes stable liposomal iohexol formulations for medical imaging applications, specifically Computed Tomography (CT). These formulations provide enhanced and sustained contrast enhancement in various regions of interest such as the aorta, heart, kidneys, liver, and blood vessels. The prolonged residence time of the formulation is advantageous for imaging studies, as it allows for clear visualization of anatomies and vasculature even after several hours post-injection.

The patent also includes methods for image reconstitution, analysis, and comparison with baseline images to quantify the decay in contrast concentration over time in different structures. The formulation's ability to retain contrast in blood vessels and not rapidly extravasate is also highlighted as a key advantage. The primary applications of these stable liposomal iohexol formulations include blood pool imaging for detecting and quantifying ischemia, detection and characterization of various tumors and cancers, monitoring and characterizing injury and healing of damaged spinal cords, and other potential applications such as detection and monitoring of inflammation, reperfusion injuries, etc.

The liposomes can also be targeted to specific cells and tissues by attaching antibodies to their surface, enhancing contrast in those areas. The compositions are relatively nontoxic, have a long residence time in the body, and avoid traditional osmolality-related toxicity problems associated with ionic contrast-enhancing media.","[{'document': 'WO 8809165 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 8911272 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 9526205 A1'}, {'document': 'US 5312615 A'}, {'document': 'US 5676928 A'}, {'document': 'US 6217849 B1'}, {'document': 'KAO CHEN-YU ET AL: ""Long-residence-time nano-scale liposomal iohexol for X-ray-based blood pool imaging.""

The key technical advancement lies in the integration of an air cooling system for control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) assemblies within the circumferential envelope of the nuclear reactor pressure vessel closure head. This integrated design includes a seismic support platform, missile shield plate, air plenums, axial flow cooling fans, and quick disconnect-connect electrical connectors for CRDM power, rod position indicator (RPI) coil cables, and thermocouple electrical cables.

The new air circulation system eliminates vertical elbow-type air ducts and replaces them with vertically extending exhaust air ducts, upper air duct manifolds, and fan ducts. The cooling air is drawn from the ambient containment air through openings in the CRDM cooling baffle assemblies, passing through the lower air manifold, and then moving upward through the exhaust air ducts, upper air duct manifolds, fan ducts, air plenum housings, and axial flow cooling fans.

A unique feature is a centralized cable connector plate that allows for disconnection of power and signal transmission cables at one location, saving time during refueling operations. The system also includes a permanent hoist and support system for the closure head that can be affixed to it without requiring dismantling or erection, saving man-hours and reducing radiation exposure time for maintenance personnel.

The patent further proposes a three-fan setup where two fans operate simultaneously while one remains idle in standby mode, reducing the likelihood of malfunction and ensuring sufficient air intake throughout the CRDM assemblies. The fans are affixed to the missile shield plate, allowing for adequate weight support, and are positioned radially within the closure head envelope, avoiding interference with tension bolt or stud hydraulic tensioning apparatus or other structural components.

power unit for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, designed to improve battery pack heating efficiency under low-temperature conditions during charging. The system employs a bidirectional DC-DC converter with various topological structures, such as LLC, DAB, CLLC, CF-DAB, and Partial-Power Converter, which enables the charge-discharge frequency of the battery pack to be adjusted between 0 to 2000Hz.

The key technical innovation lies in the use of Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) within a secondary convertor module, creating an oscillatory circuit that allows for rapid charging and discharging of the battery pack. This high-frequency process generates heat in the battery pack, eliminating the need for an additional heating apparatus within the EV.

The system includes multiple power units controlled by a main control module, which can switch the current direction of the secondary convertor module periodically to heat the battery pack when necessary. The charging pile can connect these power units in parallel or series based on the battery pack's heating power or charging voltage.

The primary application of this technology is in electric vehicle charging piles, where it aims to improve charging efficiency, extend battery lifespan, and potentially reduce charging times for EVs with low remaining battery capacity. The patent describes a charging pile system that includes multiple power units and a main control module, which determines the required direct current voltage for charging and discharging the battery pack based on its state. When heating is required, the main control module adjusts the frequency and current limit according to the battery pack's needs.

The system offers two heating frequency ranges: a first range for lower frequencies and a second range for higher frequencies. The main control module connects the power units to either a transformer module or an energy storage module depending on the heating frequency required by the battery pack. This connection mode determines the cyclic charge-discharge heating method used to heat the battery pack during charging or discharging.

The patent also includes a method for charge-discharge heating, which involves receiving a power-on request from the electric vehicle, determining the appropriate connection mode based on the heating frequency information in the request, and switching current directions accordingly to perform cyclic charging and discharging at the corresponding frequency. The temperature of the battery pack is monitored during this process, and charging stops when it reaches a temperature indicating rechargeability.

In some embodiments, after heating is completed, the secondary convertor module is directly connected to the transformer module for immediate charging without requiring users to wait or trigger additional operations. The system also allows monitoring of the battery pack's real-time capacity and stopping charging when it reaches full capacity. An optional feature includes acquiring the remaining capacity of the battery pack and heating it if its level is low before charging, improving charging efficiency and user experience by reducing waiting times and ensuring optimal battery pack temperature for recharging.","[{'document': 'CN 112599889 A'}, {'document': 'CN 113733986 A'}, {'document': 'CN 110133516 B'}, {'document': 'CN 202423513 U'}, {'document': 'CN 202423513 U'}, {'document': 'CN 202435108 U'}, {'document': 'CN 213734672 U'}, {'document': 'DE 102013226372 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2011144861 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2013181682 A1'}]","[{'document': 'CN 110133516 B'}, {'document': 'CN 202423513 U'}, {'document': 'US 2011144861 A1'}]",[],WO2023133831,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],7,"– Goal 7: The patent describes a ""dcdc conversion circuit for a charging pile"" which improves the charging efficiency and heating method of electric vehicle batteries, contributing to more efficient energy use.

The invention's potential extends beyond the specific anti-CD52 x anti-EpCAM antibody, as it can be applied to other monoclonal antibodies that interact with tumor cells and form removable associates. The antibody is designed to reduce cytokine release during use, minimizing the risk of severe inflammatory responses, and enhances its efficiency in separating tumor cells from erythrocytes by forming larger associates or aggregates with blood cells.","[{'document': 'WO 2013113615 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2014369985 A1'}]","[{'document': 'US 2014369985 A'}, {'document': 'DE 4419399 A'}, {'document': 'BENTZIEN et al.

like sanitary napkins, incontinence products, and wound dressings. The structure consists of three layers: a cover layer, a transfer layer, and a reservoir layer. The cover layer is designed to be highly wettable, hydrophilic, and porous for rapid fluid absorption, while the transfer layer acts as a holding tank for body fluids until they are absorbed by the reservoir layer. The reservoir layer has a large fluid holding capacity and functions as a capillary ""pump"" to absorb body fluids away from the transfer layer.

The patent emphasizes specific pore size distributions, water permeability, and density gradients between layers to facilitate fluid wicking away from the body. The cover layer should have many large pores (at least 15% greater than 300 µm in radius), high water permeability (preferably >15.2 m³/m²/min at 1.2 kPa), and rapid wettability. The transfer layer should have a relatively high degree of water permeability, retain its structural integrity, and have a thickness between about 0.13 cm (0.05 inches) and 0.38 cm (0.15 inches). The reservoir layer is highly dense, absorbent, and retentive, with a large fluid holding capacity.

The absorbent structure's key technical innovations include the transfer layer acting as a holding tank for body fluids, specific pore size distributions for transfer and reservoir layers, and partial slitting or needle processing for increased flexibility and absorption rate. The primary applications of this invention are sanitary napkins and diapers, aiming to provide better comfort, absorbency, and structural integrity during use by preventing bunching or roping.

The patent also covers various methods for attaching the sanitary napkin to undergarments using adhesives, Velcro attachments, or belts. The described invention is a flexible and resilient sanitary napkin that maintains its properties when wet, with increased compressive resistance and improved torsion resistance compared to other tested products. The patent also discusses various cover materials and fibrous webs suitable for use as transfer layers in the absorbent structure of the invention, with high fluid permeability being a key feature.

The primary application of this invention is in the development of improved absorbent products for various uses, such as infant diapers, adult diapers, and wound dressings. The patent's overall essence revolves around creating an efficient, comfortable, and effective absorbent structure for hygiene products that addresses common issues like bunching, roping, and poor absorption capacity.","[{'document': 'EP 0158914 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0165807 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0169184 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0217766 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0312118 A'}, {'document': 'DE 3525379 A'}, {'document': 'GB 2063683 A'}]",[],[],,"['AT', 'BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'ES', 'FR', 'GB', 'IT', 'LI', 'LU', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""wound dressing comprising the absorbent structure"", which directly contributes to ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being.",Human Necessities,Medical & Healthcare,JOHNSON & JOHNSON INC.,CA,1,"Cadieux, Serge; Levesque, Yvon",CA,2,

and intuitive control during minimally invasive procedures, such as laparoscopic surgeries or endoscopic procedures. The system incorporates a robot arm, camera, input mechanism (joystick), display device, and controller that operates in multiple modes: engaged mode, disengaged mode, operational mode, and selection mode.

In the engaged mode, surgeons can control both the robot arm and an endoscope attached to their own arm using a handheld input device. The disengaged mode decouples the input device from the robot arm in response to a clutch input signal, allowing the surgeon to control other surgical instruments or the first end effector (image capture device like an endoscope).

The operational mode is activated by receiving a signal from another input, enabling the surgeon to control the degrees of freedom (up/down, left/right, zoom in/out, and roll) of the endoscope. The selection mode is entered when the first input is decoupled from the first end effector, allowing the surgeon to select a third end effector for association with the input device.

The system provides force feedback and continuously updates mappings between input device frames of reference and end effector frames of reference to ensure movements on the display correspond to actual movements. Multiple displays can be used for additional viewing screens, which can be useful for training purposes. The input devices are designed to be comfortable and natural for users, with features like touch-sensitive panels or haptic feedback to detect user engagement and prevent inadvertent actuation.

The system's primary application is in minimally invasive surgeries, where it allows for simultaneous control of both the surgical tool and the endoscope, improving efficiency and reducing the need for multiple operators. The system can be considered as a master-slave relationship, with the operator controlling multiple remote tools (slaves) through a single input device (master).

The patent's key technical innovation is the ability to control multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) of the endoscope using a single input device, including up/down, left/right movement, zoom level, and rotation. This is achieved through software that maps the input device's movements to the corresponding DoF of the endoscope. The system also includes velocity control, allowing for adjusting the speed at which the endoscope moves in each direction.

The system allows for intuitive control by updating the mapping between the master (input device) and slave (end effector or endoscope) when the operator changes the position or orientation of the input device. The user can also set a preferred frame of reference to improve the response between the movement of the input and the movement of the endoscope.

The system permits the operator to selectively control multiple instrument end effectors using one input device, with the coupling between input devices and end effectors changeable in software control. The operator can choose the desired coupling by manipulating the respective input device or using other controls like a foot pedal or switch on the operator console.

The system's flexible control processes can be performed by one or more physical processing units executing software, allowing for additional functional inputs to the system and accessing various modes via a menu-type interface. The patent describes a versatile control system that can be applied not only to surgical applications but also to other robotic systems requiring intuitive and precise control of instruments and endoscopes.","[{'document': 'WO 2017031132 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2017055381 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2003144649 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2013211590 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2016270867 A1'}]","[{'document': 'US 20160270867 A'}, {'document': 'US 20130211590 A'}, {'document': 'GB 1616086 A'}]",[],WO2019162660,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""masterslave system"" with end effectors including ""an endoscope 41c"", which directly supports medical procedures and thus contributes to strengthening health systems.",Human Necessities,Medical & Healthcare,CMR Surgical Limited,GB,1,"MARSHALL, Keith; CUTHBERTSON, Rebecca Anne; DEANE, Gordon Thomas",GB,3,

The primary innovation is a modified gas diffusion electrode design that incorporates a CO filtering layer and a strategically arranged ruthenium catalyst and electrocatalyst to reduce the concentration of poisoning species, such as carbon monoxide (CO), in the fuel cell system.

The fuel cell system consists of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with anode and cathode substrates, a proton exchange membrane (PEM), an electrochemically separating sublayer, a poison-scrubbing catalyst layer, an anode electrocatalyst layer, and a cathode electrocatalyst layer. The poison-scrubbing catalyst removes harmful impurities from the fuel stream, while the electrocatalyst enhances the rate of electrochemical reactions like hydrogen oxidation.

The patent also describes embodiments where the poison-scrubbing and electrocatalytic catalysts are physically separated by the electrochemically separating sublayer to preserve the tolerance of the fuel cell to both poisoning species in the hydrogen gas fuel and cell reversal. The MEA structure includes anode and cathode substrates, a PEM, and electrocatalyst layers on both sides.

The patent suggests using a PrOx catalyst to facilitate and enhance the reduction of CO on gas diffusion media and incorporating a CO oxidation catalyst onto a backing layer adjacent to the MEA.

The process utilizes specific daunomycin-producing microorganisms such as Streptomyces coeruleorubidus ME130-A4, S. peucetius subsp. carneus, and their mutants.

The production method involves isolating non-producing mutant strains, selecting those capable of glycosidation of the sugar moieties formed in the cultured medium to the exogenously added anthracyclinones as substrate, and fermenting them under optimal conditions (72 hours at 28°C) with the addition of the anthracyclinones. The resulting products can be recovered with over 80% yield on a weight basis of substrate, significantly higher than the parent strain's direct fermentation procedure.

The patent also describes two alternative methods for producing daunomycin and its analogs. The first method involves extracting pigments from Streptomyces coeruleorubidus using EDTA and adjusting the pH to 8.0, followed by chromatography processes. The second method adds either aklavinone or E-rhodomycinone to the culture of S. coeruleorubidus, with varying yields depending on the added compound (more daunomycin and baumycin A2 with aklavinone, more baumycin A1 with E-rhodomycinone).

These methods are primarily used for the industrial production of antitumor antibiotics (daunomycin, baumycin A1, and baumycin A2), which have potential applications in cancer treatment due to their potent antitumor activity and low toxicity.

The method involves a power dissipating unit, such as a switch and resistor (or other components like an inductor or capacitor), which is controlled by a controller to manage the wind turbine's power output.

The controller calculates a feed forward power signal based on the difference between a reference generator power (including a ramp down power profile of the generator) and a desired turbine power (including a desired ramp down power profile). This feed forward power signal is then used to control the operation of the power dissipating unit, causing the power output from the wind turbine to decrease at a desired rate.

The primary application of this method is in wind energy generation systems that need to comply with grid codes requiring faster ramp-down rates than their maximum capabilities. This can help ensure a more stable power supply for the grid during shutdowns or other situations where the wind turbine's power output needs to be reduced quickly.

The patent also describes a duty ratio calculation method, which determines the activation time of the power dissipating unit based on the power to be dissipated and the maximum power that can be dissipated by the power dissipating circuit. The algorithm allows for faster ramp-down rates of the turbine output power compared to the generator, although the rate can be adjusted based on system or grid requirements.

The described system can be applied to both Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). The patent emphasizes that this is an example implementation, and variations and modifications by a skilled professional within the field are intended to fall under the scope of the patent claims. Primary applications could be in energy management systems, power electronics, or any system requiring efficient power dissipation control.","[{'document': 'EP 1672779 A2'}, {'document': 'EP 1863162 A2'}, {'document': 'EP 2096299 A2'}, {'document': 'US 2002190695 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2010002475 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2010138058 A1'}]","[{'document': 'EP 1863162 A2'}, {'document': 'US 2010002475 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2010138058 A1'}, {'document': 'EP 1672779 A2'}, {'document': 'EP 2096299 A2'}]",[],WO2012146250,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],7,"– Goal 7: The patent describes ""a variable speed wind turbine"" and a method of operating it, which directly contributes to increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.",Electricity; Mechanical Engineering,Electrical Power; Engines & Power Machines,Vestas Wind Systems A/S,DK,1,"GUPTA, Amit Kumar; ANDERSEN, Gert Karmisholt; FONN, Swee Yee; LI, Bing","SG, DK",4,

for detecting Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibodies using a one-step immunoassay that employs NS3 capture peptides. The technique utilizes at least two NS3 helicase (NS3h) capture peptides and conjugate peptides, with one composed mainly of Domain 1 and the other of all three domains of the NS3 helicase protein. This method extends the dynamic range for antibody detection, enabling the detection of samples containing both high and low concentrations of antibodies.

The key technical innovation is a HCV Ag/Ab Combo assay that employs two different types of NS3 peptides: one containing all three helicase domains (NS3h-D1) and the other containing only domain 1 of the helicase (NS3h-DelN15). This dual-antigen approach allows for the detection of a wider range of HCV antibody concentrations compared to using a single NS3 protein alone.

The assay process involves adding human samples, acridinylated HCV NS3 antigens, a core antigen, streptavidin coated microparticles, and biotinylated anti-Core MAb and HCV NS3 antigens to a reaction vessel. After incubation, the microparticles are sequestered using a magnet, washed, and further binding is done with acridinylated anti-core MAbs. The light output (RLU) is then measured, which is proportional to the amount of conjugate bound onto the microparticles.

The patent also provides kits and compositions containing these capture and conjugate peptides, quality control reagents like calibrators and controls for rigorous quality control in these immunoassays, and suggestions for modifications and variations for skilled artisans within the scope of the patent claims. The primary application of this method is in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of Hepatitis C, particularly in hospital-based settings or by paramedics for acute conditions and over longer periods for chronic conditions. The method can be adapted for use in automated and semi-automated systems like Abbott Laboratories' ARCHITECT® system.","[{'document': 'EP 1071955 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 9115771 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 02096941 A2'}, {'document': 'US 2004152070 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2005014136 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2005095584 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2014272933 A1'}, {'document': 'YIXIN BIAN ET AL: ""Significance of Monoclonal Antibodies against the Conserved Epitopes within Non-Structural Protein 3 Helicase of Hepatitis C Virus"", PLOS ONE, vol. 8, no. 7, 24 July 2013 (2013-07-24), page e70214, XP055242633, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0070214'}, {'document': 'F.-B.

explosive emulsions, primarily replacing non-renewable fuels like diesel with renewable oils such as vegetable oil, hydrotreated renewable oil, and biodiesel. The challenge lies in maintaining stability and viscosity suitable for various applications when using renewable oils due to their different chemistry and properties compared to non-renewable oils.

The inventors have found that adding a suitable amount of one or more secondary salts, particularly calcium nitrate (CN), can produce stable explosive emulsions with viscosities comparable to those based on non-renewable fuel oils. This method allows for replacing at least 20% (preferably 50%) of the organic phase's non-renewable oil with renewable oils, resulting in a ""greener"" explosive emulsion suitable for a wide range of applications.

The patent describes water-in-oil type emulsion explosives consisting primarily of an oxidizer phase (80-95%) and an organic phase (5-20%). The oxidizer phase includes ammonium nitrate (40-80%) and calcium nitrate, while the organic phase contains a fuel composition (1-8%) made up of renewable oils (at least 20 cP viscosity at 40°C) and optionally non-renewable oils. The explosive emulsion has a viscosity between 30,000 cP and 115,000 cP, making it suitable for various applications.

The organic phase of the explosive emulsion composition also includes an emulsifier to prevent separation of the phases and ensure stability. The emulsifier can be bio-sourced, providing a fully green solution for an explosive emulsion. Typical amounts of emulsifiers range between 12 wt.% and 50 wt.% in view of the total weight of the organic phase composition.

The patent presents various samples produced using different materials and emulsifiers for testing purposes, with a focus on improving stability while maintaining performance. The stability is determined using a Light Scattering Stability Test (LSST) that measures crystal size and number to produce a score between 0 and 20, with higher scores indicating greater stability.

The primary application of these biofuels is as an alternative to traditional fossil fuels, offering environmental benefits due to their renewability. However, the patent also discusses an innovative use for these biofuels: in the formulation of explosive emulsion compositions. By adding a suitable amount of CN and/or sodium nitrate (SN) to the oxidizer phase of the explosive emulsion composition, the inventors have found that emulsion stability is maintained, allowing for stable explosive emulsions with viscosities comparable to traditional monosalt AN/diesel based explosive emulsions.

The patent reveals that monosalt emulsions tend to crystallize during transport, regardless of the type of vegetable oil and emulsifier used. Adding a higher amount (at least 14 wt.% or 15 wt.% in the oxidizer phase) of CN as a secondary salt surprisingly stabilizes the emulsion, although it increases viscosity significantly. Replacing part of the vegetable oil with hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and adding a higher amount of CN as a secondary salt reduces viscosity while maintaining stability. The type of emulsifier used has no significant impact on viscosity or shear stress stability.

In summary, this patent proposes an improved explosive emulsion composition with potential applications in various industries, offering enhanced stability and versatility due to the use of biofuels and different emulsifiers. The patent describes a method for evaluating the stability of explosive emulsions, specifically monosalt emulsions with ammonium nitrate in the oxidizer phase and vegetable oil as fuel in the organic phase. The stability is determined using a Light Scattering Stability Test (LSST) that measures crystal size and number to produce a score between 0 and 20, with higher scores indicating greater stability.","[{'document': 'GB 2120228 A'}, {'document': 'US 4931110 A'}, {'document': 'US 2004020573 A1'}]",[{'document': 'US 2004020573 A'}],[],WO2022189381,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],12,"– Goal 12: The patent describes an explosive composition that uses ""between 50 wt. and 100 wt., particularly between 70wt. and 100wt., of one or more renewable oils"" which promotes sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.",Chemistry & Metallurgy,Other Chemistry & Metallurgy,Yara International ASA,NO,1,"LEDOUX, Francois; CHLADEK, Petr","FR, NO",2,

The system consists of multiple interconnected vehicles, each equipped with an electric motor, an electric power generating device (like a diesel engine), and an EPSD.

The key innovation is a train control device that manages the operation of the EPSD and electric power generating devices based on driving commands and the operating state. It prevents steep charge and discharge currents into and from the EPSD, minimizing energy loss and maintaining suitable temperatures for the EPSD to extend its life.

The system addresses overcharging during braking by managing the storage capacity of the EPSD. When the EPSD is fully charged, regenerative braking is not performed, and instead, a pneumatic brake is applied. This helps save labor required for maintenance and parts replacement.

The patent's primary application is in electric-powered trains, where it can improve energy efficiency, extend battery life, and enhance overall train performance. The system dynamically adjusts the operating state based on the charged state of the battery and the train's operating condition. It includes a flowchart for controlling the discharge current of the battery, starting and operating engines at high efficiency or maximum output points, and maintaining the required electric power for the train's travel.

The patent also describes a method for managing multiple electric power generating devices in a railway vehicle. This involves controlling each electric power generating device to switch from an optimal output state to a maximum output state when the discharge current of the EPSD reaches a threshold value. When the discharge current exceeds the threshold value, all electric power generating devices are operated at maximum output to compensate for energy deficiency.

The patent includes methods for preparing these substituted 1,4-oxathiins, fungicidal compositions containing them, and a method for controlling fungi using the fungicidal compositions. The compounds can be applied to plants through various methods such as foliar application, systemic application, or seed coating. The carrier in the fungicidal compositions can be an inert material, solution, water emulsion, dispersant, wettable powder, or aerosol.

A key technical innovation is the use of these compounds as active ingredients in an aerosol carrier that is liquid only under elevated pressure and gas at ordinary temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The preferred carriers for the production of fungicidal compositions are solvents and emulsions.

The patent provides examples of preparing specific compounds (Compound Nos. 1-18) through a chemical reaction process, which involves heating a mixture of the starting material, a triazole or imidazole, triphenylphosphine, carbon tetrachloride, and acetonitrile. The resulting product is then purified using HPLC.

The key technical innovation involves determining common points (coordinates) between surface objects from one data set and volume objects from another data set, which have a pre-defined relationship to each other. This method allows for more precise matching, increased flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and potential improvements in patient safety compared to existing methods.

The system consists of units that identify portions of surface and volume objects, determine coordinates based on these objects, and match the data sets using the pre-defined relationships between coordinates. The computer program product contains instructions for performing this method when executed on a programmable device.

By determining common points with a pre-defined relationship, the matched data can be provided with high precision, even when one or more objects are missing in one of the data sets due to image artefacts. This method also allows for reliable matching using at least three common points or one axis with a pre-determined direction in each set of data.

The patent includes methods for virtually planning dental restorations, producing products for medical procedures related to dental restorations, and a scanning appliance that conforms to a portion of the craniofacial space and can be identified from multiple data sets. The method involves freeform manufacturing a device with at least one surface object and at least one volume object.

The merged data set is used for virtual planning of dental restorative procedures, providing high precision production data for products like dental implants, bridge frameworks, anchor pins, surgical templates, etc. The invention aims to reduce errors in the dental planning and production system, resulting in final products that conform precisely to the real anatomical craniofacial situation, improving the fit of products used in dental restorative procedures.

Applications primarily focus on dental restorative procedures but can also extend to bone shaping by surgical templates, positioning of anchoring elements, and orthodontic procedures. The patent suggests using surface markers with different resolutions for the two types of scanning, addressing issues that arose from previously mismatched data. The method can be automated or semi-automated for quicker identification and matching, reducing the need for computational power compared to previous methods.

The patent describes various embodiments of surface objects and volume objects, as well as their related coordinates, and provides illustrations for better understanding. The patent also suggests using surface objects with enclosed volume objects filled with radiopaque materials to facilitate identification and matching of the two sets of data. The system described can be part of a larger system for planning craniofacial treatment procedures or producing products for these procedures.

system, particularly for mobile users roaming in foreign networks. The main innovation is the use of user plane connections to communicate at least part of location service information, reducing load on the control plane and improving efficiency compared to traditional methods that rely solely on the control plane.

The primary application of this method is to determine a mobile user's geographical location during roaming, facilitating transmission of this information back to their home network for purposes such as emergency services, commercial tracking, or routing and charging. The patent addresses the challenge of a mobile user equipment not knowing the identity or address of the local user plane enabled location service entity in a roamed network, proposing methods to ensure secure communication between the user equipment and the location service entity.

The proposed method is applicable to various types of mobile user equipment (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, personal data assistants) and different communication systems (cellular networks, satellite-based systems, local wireless area networks). The system supports multiple location service entities, including a controlling server and user plane location servers, which provide current or most recent geographic locations of target user equipment upon request.

In the event of an emergency call, a network element can detect and request location information for the target user equipment. For regular usage, the user equipment communicates its location to a local location service server, which then provides the location data to the client application. The UE may store the user plane address of legitimate location service entities in its memory, allowing it to verify that the network entity is authorized to receive location information during roaming.

In summary, the primary applications of this system are emergency call handling and regular location-based services for mobile users, with key technical innovations involving user plane communications, network element-initiated location procedures, and UE authorization during roaming.

producing butadiene through an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of butene, specifically focusing on the start-up and purge processes to prevent catalyst deterioration. The key technical innovation lies in introducing oxygen into a reactor before or simultaneously with butene during the start-up process, which prevents activity loss of the catalyst. This approach aims to maintain the catalyst's activity and improve the yield of butadiene production.

The primary application is in the chemical industry for the production of butadiene, a crucial base oil used in synthetic rubber manufacturing. The process involves introducing a reactant containing butene, oxygen, nitrogen, and steam into a reactor filled with a catalyst, followed by cooling, compression, absorption, and recirculation steps to separate and recycle the products.

In case of an emergency or process interruption, a purge process is performed by introducing air and/or steam into the reactor to stop the reaction, maintain the same temperature as during the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, and quickly recover normal operation. The steam used in the process can be fresh or recycled wastewater distillation steam from the product after the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

The oxidative dehydrogenation reaction takes place at temperatures between 250°C and 500°C, with optimal efficiency achieved within a range of 300°C to 450°C. The molar ratio of butene : oxygen : nitrogen : steam can vary, but an example is 1 : (0.5 to 1.2) : (5 to 12) : (0.5 to 5).

The reactor used in the process can be any suitable type for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as tube-type, batch-type, fluidized bed, or fixed bed reactors. The method can also be performed using two connected reactors in series.

The butene used in the reaction can be a C4 mixture containing normal butenes and optionally normal butane or C4 raffinate-3. Oxygen serves as an oxidant, while nitrogen and steam are introduced to reduce explosion danger, prevent coking of the catalyst, remove reaction heat, etc. The reaction produces butadiene and side products like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which should be separated to prevent accumulation in the process.

The patent describes specific examples for preparing the catalyst and conducting the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, as well as experimental conditions for start-up, purge, restart, and shut-down scenarios. The method is expected to improve the efficiency and safety of butadiene production processes.","[{'document': 'EP 3272417 A1'}, {'document': 'EP 3272417 B1'}, {'document': 'WO 2017122103 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2018029215 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2018139776 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2018178005 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2014128718 A2'}, {'document': 'JP 2010280653 A'}, {'document': 'KR 20130046458 A'}, {'document': 'KR 20140121467 A'}, {'document': 'KR 20160143272 A'}, {'document': 'KR 20170108277 A'}, {'document': 'KR 20180046648 A'}, {'document': 'KR 101577759 B1'}, {'document': 'US 2012130137 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2016347686 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2018147561 A1'}]","[{'document': 'JP 2010280653 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2018029215 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2018178005 A1'}]",[],WO2020111431,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],12,"– Goal 12: The patent describes a method where ""the steam to be introduced into the reactor is wastewater distillation steam recycled from the product after the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction"", contributing to target 12.5 to substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse.",Chemistry & Metallurgy; Performing Operations & Transport,Chemical Processes; Mechanical Tools & Equipment,"LG CHEM, LTD.",KR,1,"SUH, Myungji; KANG, Jun Han; CHA, Kyong Yong; KO, Dong Hyun",KR,4,

The anodes are particularly suitable for forming electrolytic copper foil, especially when shaped as cylinders or portions of a cylinder to conform to the shape of the mandrel or drum. They exhibit high durability even at elevated temperatures (up to 90°C) and sulfuric acid concentrations (100-250 grams/liter), making them valuable for various applications including high-speed production of copper foil, electrogalvanizing, electrowinning, and electrosynthesis involving oxygen evolution.

The anode's performance was tested in electroforming copper foils at specific conditions, demonstrating its durability with an essentially constant overvoltage of 2.83 volts after 4,000 hours of operation. Comparative tests show that the anode made with a higher temperature for IrO₂ formation fails earlier than the one described in the patent.

In summary, this patent introduces a novel type of anode designed to produce high-purity, pore-free electrolytic copper foil efficiently and economically under severe conditions, offering significant benefits for industries requiring such materials, particularly those involved in high-speed production of copper foil, electrogalvanizing, electrowinning, and electrosynthesis.","[{'document': 'EP 0026482 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0027367 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0046447 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0090425 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0129374 A'}, {'document': 'CH 563464 A'}, {'document': 'US 4203810 A'}, {'document': 'US 4331528 A'}, {'document': 'US 4372824 A'}, {'document': 'PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, unexamined applications, C field, vol. 4, no. 178, December 10, 1980 THE PATENT OFFICE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, page 125 C 34, Kokai-no. 55-119 198 (SHIN NIPPON SEITETSU K.K.)'}, {'document': 'PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, unexamined applications, C field, vol. 5, no. 106, July 10, 1981 THE PATENT OFFICE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, page 138 C 62, Kokai-no. 56-47 597 (SHIN NIPPON SEITETSU K.K.)'}, {'document': 'PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, unexamined application, E section, vol. 1, no. 37, April 18, 1977 THE PATENT OFFICE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, page 2034 E 76, Kokai-no. 51-133 789 (KIYOTERU TAKAYASU)'}]",[],[],,"['AT', 'BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'FR', 'GB', 'IT', 'LI', 'LU', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],9,"– Goal 9: The patent describes an anode coating for electrochemical processes, which contributes to upgrading industrial processes, specifically ""electroforming of copper foil"", which aligns with target 9.4 to ""upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes"".

the production of elements with both pervious (porous) and non-pervious (solid) regions. The key technical innovation lies in the ability to change printer settings during the printing process, allowing for the formation of porous structures that maintain a non-stick surface, as well as solid structures. This method is particularly useful for creating molds or trays used in various industries such as food production, automotive, aerospace, and medical devices.

The primary application of this invention is in manufacturing three-dimensional objects with integrated porous and solid parts, such as metallic elements like Stainless Steel, Titanium, or Tantalum. The pervious part serves as a non-stick surface for various applications such as cutting devices, storage containers, hoppers, conveyor systems, bearings, and boundary layer control systems on transport devices.

In the case of cutting devices, the non-stick surface ensures clean cutting without residue. For storage containers, hoppers, and conveyor systems, it allows for easy removal or transportation of products with minimal residue. In bearings, the non-stick surface reduces friction between moving parts, potentially using lubricants or gas for low-friction interfaces.

In boundary layer control systems on transport devices like aircraft, ships, or cars, the element can help control fluid flow boundary layers to reduce drag and prevent separation. This is achieved by introducing a pressurized fluid through the pervious material or sucking away the low momentum layer at the surface of the transport device.

The patent also presents methods for producing elements with both impervious and pervious parts using a three-dimensional printing process, where parameters like irradiation power, scanning speed, distance between adjacent scanning lines, and focus position are adjusted to create porous or pervious material. The entire area of the pervious part is irradiated by the laser beam during the printing process, resulting in the formation of pervious or porous material within the irradiated parts.

Key technical innovations include integrally forming secondary tubes within a main body using a 3D printing process and heat-conducting material. These secondary tubes allow the passage of a second fluid while preventing mixing with the first fluid due to their impervious walls. The patent also describes creating an element with a permeable layer, non-stick surface, an impermeable layer, and a series of ducts for feeding pressurized fluid. This design allows for interaction between the fluid and the boundary layer, potentially increasing turbulence to reduce drag.

The patent also covers vacuum forming molds, which have an inner wall with a pervious material and an outer wall with an impervious material. A series of ducts embedded in the pervious material allow air to be sucked out during the vacuum forming process, helping to shape the material against the mold’s surface. After forming, pressurized fluid can be used to push the shaped material away from the inner wall for easier removal.

Lastly, a cutting device with a porous or pervious cutting blade is described. The blade has an internal chamber connected to the porous material and bridged by strengthening elements. A source of pressurized fluid can be connected to the chamber to nullify adhesion of the product being cut to the non-stick surface of the cutting blade.

Primary applications for these innovations include molding, vacuum forming, and cutting processes in various industries. The patent describes inventions related to various structures, including storage containers, transport tubes, troughs, bearings, and glue connections. Key technical innovations include using a three-dimensional printing process to create pervious and impervious materials within the same structure. The pervious materials allow for the introduction of pressurized fluids that increase the flowability of granular materials in storage containers or reduce friction in transport tubes, troughs, and bearings. In some cases, these structures are designed to fluidize granular materials. The primary applications of these inventions include transportation, storage, and heat exchange systems. For example, the transport tubes and troughs can be used for conveying products with reduced friction, while the storage containers can improve the flowability of granular materials. The bearings and glue connections offer improved lubrication and stronger interconnections, respectively. The heat exchanger utilizes a combination of pervious and impervious materials to transfer heat between two fluids.

The patent also highlights the advantages of these integrated components for hygienic applications in the food industry due to their seamless or jointless transition between permeable and impermeable parts.","[{'document': 'WO 2017117527 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2004002229 A2'}, {'document': 'JP 2002322501 A'}, {'document': 'US 2014010908 A1'}]","[{'document': 'WO 2004002229 A2'}, {'document': 'US 20140010908 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2017117527 A1'}]",[],WO2019066659,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],"6,9","– Goal 6: The method produces an element with both pervious and non-pervious parts, where the pervious part allows ""a fluid to flow through the pervious part"", which can be applied to water filtration systems.

The key technical breakthrough involves replacing traditional carbon-paper or thin film counter electrodes with a metal grid, such as copper mesh, which effectively balances half-cell reactions at low potentials, preventing water electrolysis and reducing response time.

The proposed electrochromic cell design consists of two glass substrates, one coated with a transparent conductive film (e.g., tin oxide) and an electrochromic film (e.g., tungsten oxide). A metal grid counter electrode (copper mesh in this case) is positioned adjacent to the second uncoated glass substrate, with an ion-conductive polymer sandwiched between the two glass substrates. The copper grid is embedded at its interface with the uncoated glass substrate.

The low voltage of the cell ensures that water electrolysis reactions do not occur, allowing the metal grid counter electrode to participate in balancing half-cell reactions at lower potentials. This design results in improved optical properties by preventing gas evolution and maintaining transparency over large surface areas. The invention can be applied to various electrochromic materials like transition metal oxides, sulfides, stannates, etc., and the ion-conductive layer may accommodate other ions such as lithium. The metal mesh counter electrode can also be made of nickel or other metals/alloys, with its surface potentially coated with materials like tungsten oxide or niobium oxide for optimal half-cell reaction balancing.

The primary application of these transparent electrochromic windows is in large transparent articles such as windows, where traditional designs may not be suitable due to issues with lateral electrical resistance and gas evolution from the counter electrode. The overall goal is to create a high-performance, transparent electrochromic cell design for use as a window that maintains transparency while preventing gas evolution during electrolysis of water.","[{'document': 'EP 0017977 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0028147 A'}, {'document': 'US 3575489 A'}, {'document': 'US 3879108 A'}, {'document': 'US 4006966 A'}, {'document': 'US 4167309 A'}]",[],[],,"['DE', 'FR', 'GB', 'IT']",[],[],7,"– Goal 7: The electrochromic window has ""variable transtransmittance in response to an electric field"", which can reduce energy consumption for lighting and heating/cooling.",Physics,Optics & Imaging,"PPG INDUSTRIES, INC.",US,1,"Greenberg, Charles Bernard; Singleton, David Ellis",US,2,

The core innovation is a honeycomb-structured adsorbent, which allows air to be forced through the pores of a porous material (typically a hollow fibre) when there's a pressure differential between two volumes, reducing the need for purge air and potentially eliminating it in certain cases.

The device incorporates a heating element to increase the air's capacity to carry water and facilitate rapid evaporation of water during purging. A filter is also included to remove particulate and molecular impurities from the treated air. The porous material can be nano-porous for improved performance.

The device operates by drying wet air through a two-stage process: first, the wet air is pumped into one aperture, passes through the porous material where water molecules are adsorbed, and becomes drier as it travels along the column. Second, the dried air is then pumped out of the other aperture. A pressure differential between the two volumes causes air to pass through the porous material from the second volume to the first, acting as a reservoir of dry air.

When the porous material becomes saturated with water molecules, it needs to be regenerated by purging with dry air to remove adsorbed water molecules. The patent also suggests using multiple hollow columns in practice and a regenerative filter to remove impurities such as oils or particulate solids from the air.

The device can be adapted for use with other gases and is not limited to treating only air, making it an adaptable solution for removing impurities from various fluids. The patent's scope is defined by the appended claims and may encompass examples beyond those provided in the description.","[{'document': 'GB 397128 A'}, {'document': 'JP 8084907 A'}, {'document': 'US 2379321 A'}, {'document': 'US 4919695 A'}, {'document': 'US 5108464 A'}, {'document': 'US 2003205130 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2004118747 A1'}, {'document': 'US 6364936 B1'}]","[{'document': 'US 4919695 A'}, {'document': 'US 2379231 A'}, {'document': 'US 20030205130 A'}, {'document': 'US 20040118747 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2007007051 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2008110820 A1'}]",[],WO2009053760,"['AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'TR']",[],[],6,"– Goal 6: The patent explicitly describes ""a method of removing impurities from a fluid"" which directly contributes to improving water quality and sanitation.

innovative X-ray imaging system designed to enhance dental and medical radiology by addressing common issues such as patient discomfort, high radiation exposure, low image quality, and lack of instantaneous images. The system is composed of three main components: a dental radiography system, a medical imaging system, and a specialized X-ray scanning system for panoramic images.

The dental radiography system features interchangeable probe members and collimators, enabling instantaneous images, electronic storage, and potential processing through electronic enhancement techniques. The medical imaging system adjusts the focal length and positions the beam deflection area as needed to produce high-definition X-ray images. The specialized X-ray scanning system reduces radiation exposure while producing high-quality panoramic images.

Additional innovations include adjustable probe configurations for various types of radiographs, a support mechanism that can bend or be rigid, control circuit components designed to reduce optical distortions, delinearization of scanning sweep speeds in both X and Y directions, and methods for correcting variable magnification effects, image degradation, and non-uniform irradiation.

The primary application of this technology is in dental radiography, medical imaging, and inspection of inanimate objects like metallurgical castings using X-ray imaging. The system includes a control circuit with components such as sweep frequency generators, photomultiplier tubes, adjustable gain amplifiers, differential amplifiers, and selectable DC voltage sources. It proposes compensation circuits to minimize distortions, relying on electronic function generators and multipliers, including a tangent function generator for compensating variable magnification effects in X-ray tubes during scanning.

The technology improves X-ray imaging quality by compensating for various distortions and degradations, such as variations in radiolucence of the subject, inverse square law effects, and absorption variations in the target anode plate. It uses a larger detector positioned between the tube and the focal point, allowing for better image quality within constricted spaces like a dental patient's mouth.

The system can capture panoramic images by shifting the X-ray tube and detector along an arc and translating them parallel to the rotational axis. It also introduces an additional collimator to reduce image degradation due to scattered radiation, improving image contrast. The stored images can be reproduced or enhanced using techniques similar to those used in television systems or computed tomography. The primary application of this technology is in medical imaging, particularly dental X-ray imaging, where high-quality images are essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.",[],[],[],,"['BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'FR', 'GB', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""scanning xray apparatus"" which contributes to medical imaging and diagnostics, thus improving healthcare.

Speed Variable Frequency (ISVF) generator-based power systems. The primary focus is on maintaining stable voltages in power distribution systems, particularly within aircraft or other vehicles, where such stability is crucial to prevent damage to load equipment.

The system employs a generator control unit that generates excitation voltage reference components based on the shaft frequency, measured output voltage, and reference voltage of the ISVF generator. It includes a frequency-to-voltage converter, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, an excitation source controller, and additional circuits for controlling the excitation frequency and phase angle.

The PID controller generates a second excitation voltage reference component based on the difference between the reference voltage and the measured output voltage of the ISVF generator. The excitation source controller then generates an excitation voltage control signal that regulates the voltage magnitude of the excitation signal produced by the ISVF generator's associated excitation source.

A lookup table is used to map shaft frequency values to excitation voltage references for no-load conditions, ensuring a constant output voltage magnitude when the ISVF generator is not under load. The system can also control the frequency and phase angle of the excitation signal.

The method involves generating a first excitation voltage reference component based on the shaft frequency of the ISVF generator, and a second component based on the difference between a reference voltage and the measured output voltage. These components are combined to create an excitation voltage control signal that regulates the voltage magnitude of the excitation signal.

of the engine system before operation. The technology involves a controlling apparatus that receives predicted vehicle operational information, such as initialization time, engine operation, road conditions, traffic, weather, and vehicle routes, to determine whether cold-start emissions exceed a threshold criterion.

If the threshold is met, the controlling apparatus preconditions at least part of the engine system, including the engine, exhaust aftertreatment system (EATS), or its subcomponents, using combustion or electrical heating elements. The EATS is designed to convert NOx emissions from various types of engines, including hydrogen engines.

The patent also includes a method for predicting and adapting vehicle operations based on upcoming road events, such as road curves, uphills, downhills, or parking lots. This prediction leads to engine operations like gear adaptation (downshifting), reduced engine speed, or engine shut-off. To further reduce cold-start emissions, the system preconditions parts of the engine system, typically through thermal preconditioning using electrical heating elements strategically placed in various positions within the engine system.

The primary application is for hybrid vehicles, particularly those with diesel engines and EATS systems. The patent also describes an engine system that uses both rechargeable energy storage (RESS) and a fuel cell for powering an electric machine. During preconditioning, the RESS, fuel cell, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst are heated using combustion or electrical heating elements, and the SCR catalyst is preconditioned by injecting reductant into it to reach a predetermined level of ammonia storage.

The overall goal of this patent is to improve the performance of these systems during cold starts, reducing emissions and optimizing vehicle operation, leading to energy savings, reduced costs, and lower environmental impact.","[{'document': 'EP 3375994 A1'}, {'document': 'DE 102016216492 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2012247084 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2020240307 A1'}]","[{'document': 'US 2020240307 A'}, {'document': 'EP 3375994 A'}, {'document': 'US 2012247084 A'}, {'document': 'DE 102016216492'}]",[],,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],13,"– Goal 13: The patent explicitly aims to reduce emissions, contributing to climate action by ""reducing coldstart emission of the predicted engine operation with preconditioning of at least said part of the engine system.""",Mechanical Engineering,Other Mechanical Engineering,VOLVO TRUCK CORPORATION,SE,1,"DAHL, Johan; WILHELMSSON, Martin; STJERNBERG, Oscar",SE,3,

The double emulsion consists of a continuous fat phase and a dispersed water phase containing fat and protein, aiming to provide a stable product with good appearance and organoleptic properties without phase inversion or exudation during processing or storage.

Key technical innovations include the removal of air from the system before introducing the fatty phase, feeding the fatty phase and oil-in-water emulsion as concentric streams in the emulsification unit, careful proportioning of the oil-in-water emulsion, deaerating the water used for preparing the aqueous phase, remelting and reworking a small portion of the final product, maintaining a specific viscosity range in the oil-in-water emulsion, efficient protein solubilization, using buffering salts to maintain the emulsion's pH, and controlling the particle size of the dispersed fat.

The process is primarily applied in the production of spreadable food products like margarine or dairy alternatives. It involves preparing an aqueous phase with various additives, followed by the addition of sodium caseinate and high-energy stirring to solubilize the protein. The deaerated protein solution is then combined with a fat phase containing a specific blend of oils and emulsifier.

The mixing of the two phases in an emulsification unit creates the oil-in-water-in-oil emulsion, which is then pasteurized and cooled in a series of surface-scraped heat exchangers. The final product exhibits excellent organoleptic properties and does not exhibit exudation during storage. An additional variation of the process includes re-melting and re-feeding a portion of the emulsion back into the heat exchangers to improve the product's quality.

The device comprises a test tube and an elongated sampling tube that fits within it, with a piston head at the bottom of the sampling tube creating a sliding seal with the sidewalls of the test tube. A filter inside the piston head strains fluid into the interior of the sampling tube, leaving residue in the test tube.

The innovation lies in the addition of a one-way valve in the filter head between the filter and the interior of the sampling tube to prevent backflow and isolate the serum from the residue, providing an ion exchange barrier after filtration. The one-way valve consists of a ball chamber with a seat for the ball, which seals when pressed by reduced pressure beneath the piston head.

The device's design ensures consistent prevention of backflow and complete isolation of the serum from the residue, allowing for effective ion barrier filtration. The serum can be stored for up to 72 hours after separation without leaking out of the sampling tube. The key components include a test tube, a sampling tube with an elastomeric piston head and filter, and a one-way valve with a ball and seat mechanism.

The patent also describes the piston head's design in detail, featuring an annular wall surrounding the opening for the ball chamber that tapers outward slightly to form a wedging seat for the ball. The ball has a specific gravity greater than that of the serum, enabling it to fall back down and close the opening after the sampling process. The top wall of the piston head features an aperture in the form of four slots intersecting at the center, facilitating insertion of the ball and directing the flow of serum into the sampling tube while preventing serum from squirting out during operation.

The proposed method involves filling the hollow fiber with liquid and subjecting it to gas pressure outside the fiber, causing bubbles to form at the pinholes. These bubbles can be detected using either an electrostatic capacity-based or light-based bubble detector during continuous production of hollow fibers.

The electrostatic capacity method estimates the size of pinholes based on the magnitude of the electrostatic capacity change caused by injecting a bubble into the fiber through a pinhole. Meanwhile, the optical (light-based) method detects the presence of bubbles by total reflection of light at the boundary surface between the bubble and the core liquid. Both methods allow for the detection of small pinholes without cutting or destroying the fiber, making it suitable for testing hollow fibers during production.

The patent also suggests that other light sources and angles can be used as long as the light is sufficiently parallel and the light detector is placed in a symmetrical position with respect to the hollow fiber. If detected pinholes are repaired, high-quality hollow fibers can be obtained, ensuring their efficient performance in various applications.",[],[],[],,"['DE', 'FR', 'GB', 'NL']",[],[],6,"– Goal 6: The patent describes ""a method of detecting pinholes in hollow fibers"" which are ""semipermeable fibers"", contributing to water purification and safe water access.

The key innovation involves the creation of compositions containing at least one agriculturally beneficial biological control agent (such as Bacillus firmus CNCM 1-1582 spore) and at least one insect control agent (like clothianidin, imidacloprid, etc.). These compositions can be applied to seeds, plants, or soil, either pre-emergence, post-emergence, or both.

The primary application of these compositions is in agriculture, particularly in regions conducive to nematode infestation and fungal diseases. The combination aims to improve plant vigor and yield by enhancing the mass of the plant's root system, which supports the growth of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere, reducing losses due to nematodes or fungi. In some cases, insect control agents can increase root mass even in the absence of insect pressure, thereby improving overall crop health.

The compositions may also include additional chemical compounds with nematicidal or fungicidal properties for use in areas with extreme infestation or heavy disease pressure. The patent describes a method for treating plants with a combination of biological control agents (BCAs) and insecticides or fungicides to combat high populations of nematodes and heavy fungal disease pressure.

The preferred combinations include Fluoxastrobin, Ipconazole, Metalaxyl, Mefenoxam, Prothioconazole, Pyraclostrobin, Trifloxystrobin, BYF 14182, or azoxystrobin as fungicides, and Clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, methiocarb, thiodicarb, beta-cyfluthrin, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, tefluthrin, emamectin-benzoate, avermectin, spirodiclofen, spiromesifen, spirotetramat, flubendiamide, chlorantraniliprole (Rynaxypyr), or Cyantraniliprole (Cyazypyr) as insect control agents.

The compositions can be formulated as a seed treatment and applied using conventional methods like rotary coaters, drum coaters, or fluidized bed techniques. The patent also mentions optional additives such as binders, colorants, trace nutrients, polymer dust control agents, and agriculturally acceptable carriers to enhance the seed treatment formulations.

The unexpected benefits of these compositions are attributed to the combination of nematicidal and/or fungicidal properties of the biological control agent and the root-mass enhancing properties of the insect control agent. The agents also exhibit synergistic effects, extending beyond the sum of the activity of both individually applied active compounds, allowing for optimization of the amount of active compound applied.

The compositions can be used with transgenic seeds that express proteins directed against pests and pathogens. The treatment of such seed with these agents can further improve the effectiveness of the protection from pest and pathogen infestation. Examples provided in the patent demonstrate the ability of certain bacteria to colonize root systems, growth enhancements obtained through the use of neonicotinoid insecticides, and the synergistic effect between biological nematicides and non-nematicidal neonicotinoid insecticides in improving plant growth and yield, particularly in soil infested with Soybean Cyst nematodes.","[{'document': 'EP 0677247 A'}, {'document': 'WO 9632840 A'}, {'document': 'WO 9823157 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2007149817 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2009126473 A1'}, {'document': 'DD 267420 A1'}, {'document': 'DE 2250085 A1'}, {'document': 'FR 2760600 A'}, {'document': 'US 6406690 B1'}]","[{'document': 'WO 2007149817 A'}, {'document': 'US 5215747 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2007115644 A'}, {'document': 'US 6406690 B'}, {'document': 'US 6753296 B'}, {'document': 'WO 2007115643 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2007115646 A'}, {'document': 'EP 0539588 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2007149134 A'}, {'document': 'US 7033621 B'}, {'document': 'The Pesticide Manual British Crop Protection Council 20030000'}, {'document': 'CARLSON et al.

The SPF and HA can be cross-linked using various linker moieties, with the degree of modification ranging from 2.0% to 20.0%. This tissue filler is designed for use in soft tissue defects, particularly cosmetic applications such as filling wrinkles, skin stretch marks, or other dermal regions to improve skin conditions like dehydration, lack of elasticity, roughness, and tautness. The properties of the filler can be tailored based on the specific tissue defect, with adjustable storage modulus (G') and particle size of calcium hydroxyapatite.

The primary innovation lies in the use of silk protein fragments as a key component in tissue fillers, which can be adjusted in size, concentration, and polydispersity for specific applications. The tissue filler is intended for non-therapeutic cosmetic treatments such as facial augmentation or reconstruction, with potential benefits of reduced inflammation and increased collagen production compared to control tissue fillers.

The patent also introduces methods for creating dermal fillers using a combination of silk and hyaluronic acid (HA), which can stimulate natural collagen production and have adjustable stiffness and longevity based on the concentration of HA. The primary application of these fillers is in cosmetic procedures for skin rejuvenation and volume enhancement.

The patent introduces a high-concentration HA tissue filler composition, which could potentially be used for various medical applications such as bone repair or augmentation due to its biocompatibility and potential for promoting bone growth. The patent also discusses the gelation of silk gels using acids, electricity, mixing, sonication, and various additives, and methods for modifying and cross-linking hydrogels.

The primary application of these cross-linked gels and hydrogels is as biocompatible dermal fillers with variable residence times after injection.

The optical properties of these tissue fillers can range from transparent to opaque, depending on factors such as SPF concentration, degree of crystallinity, and hydrogel homogeneity.

The patent covers methods of preparing these tissue fillers by combining Silicon-based Protein Filler (SPF) and Hyaluronic Acid (HA), often with additional agents and potential cross-linking agents. The ratio of SPF to HA can vary significantly. The primary application of these tissue fillers is in treating soft tissue conditions such as facial augmentations, reconstructions, diseases, disorders, defects, or imperfections. They can be used to treat various skin issues, breast imperfections, neck imperfections, and other soft tissue deformities or disorders.

The key innovation in these tissue fillers is the inclusion of SPF in hyaluronic acid (HA) based tissue fillers, which promotes new collagen deposition or formation through an adjustable inflammatory response. This is achieved by using SPF solutions with narrow polydispersities, allowing for control over the extent of the inflammatory response and subsequent collagen formation.

The device utilizes an electronic flash tube or strobe tube, with light emission controlled via a first photosensor that measures the emitted light directly. An integrating circuit processes the electric signal from the photosensor according to a manually set integral constant, stopping light emission when the integrated output reaches a predetermined value. This method offers more accurate control compared to traditional techniques, reducing the need for expensive switches or large-sized resistors.

The device is compact, cost-effective, and supports both automatic and manual exposure settings. In one embodiment, a second photosensor receives reflected light, and an amplifier circuit converts and amplifies the photocurrent signal. A changeover switch enables seamless transition between autoexposure (using the second photosensor) and manual exposure (using the first photosensor).

In autoexposure mode, the device determines the amount of exposure based on the integrated light signal, which is independent of the distance between the endoscope and the subject. However, the integral constant must be adjusted according to the subject distance in this mode. Another embodiment includes a second photosensor measuring light reflected from a film in the camera, allowing for switching between autoexposure (using the second photosensor) and manual exposure (using the first photosensor). This design enhances the photographing function by offering a choice between automatic and manual exposure settings.

cimetidine and omeprazole. These compounds are designed to inhibit gastric acid secretion and provide cytoprotection by blocking the key enzyme of the gastric proton pump (H+ + K+) ATPase in the gastric endoplasmic reticulum, thereby treating gastric or duodenal ulcers.

The cycloheptenopyridine derivatives are represented by a general formula with various substituents such as lower alkyl groups, halogen atoms, lower alkoxy groups, and amido groups. They can exist in different stereoisomers, including tautomers, diastereomers, enantiomers, etc., and can be synthesized using various methods.

The patent also describes the synthesis of sulfinyl-cycloheptenopyridine derivatives (compounds [I]) with potential applications as antiulcer drugs. The synthesis process involves converting a 4-halo derivative to an alcohol or amine in the presence of a base, followed by heating with acetic anhydride, hydrolysis, or reactions involving reactive derivatives and 2-mercaptobenzimidazole or 2-mercapto[4,5-b]imidazopyridine derivatives.

Additionally, the patent describes the synthesis of various derivatives of 2,3-cycloheptenopyridine-N-oxide, including nitro-, chloro-, methoxy-, and ethoxy-substituted compounds. These compounds can be formulated into pharmaceutical agents like tablets, capsules, granules, powders, or fine granules, with a typical dosage ranging from 0.5 to 1,000 mg for adults, usually administered 1 to 3 times per day.

The key innovation lies in a planar coil structure that responds to the magnetic field generated by a current in a conductor in the near-field, while being immune to signals from neighboring conductors or connectors. This immunity is achieved through a coil-set optimized for measuring current in a bus bar while rejecting current from other neighboring bus bars and sources of magnetic interference.

The sensor system consists of multiple magnetic dipole coils (typically three) that create a higher-order magnetic function, providing immunity to adjacent conductors and rapid sensitivity drop-off with distance. The coils are designed to have substantially zero total turns-area, eliminating far field response and uniform field response, making the sensor insensitive to first-order gradient magnetic fields.

The mid-field response is balanced by adjusting the proportional area of different coil segments while maintaining the zero total turns-area constraint. This allows the sensor to have a null in the response to a known current path at a known distance, improving accuracy and reducing interference from neighboring sensors. The system can be scaled for various spacings of adjacent conductors, sensitivity adjustments, and current-carrying capacities.

The current sensor assembly is constructed using printed circuit board techniques for precision and rigidity, with the conductor fixed to the circuit board carrying the coils. The EMF from the sensor coil is proportional to the rate of change of current in the conductor, which can be processed using known digital integration techniques.

The patent also includes a processing device for analyzing, controlling, storing, and reporting measurements obtained by the coils. This forms the basis of a complete polyphase electricity meter. The system includes optional preprocessing units for basic signal conditioning, filtering, and anti-aliasing, as well as separate processing semiconducting devices to obtain current signals.

The electricity meter can communicate measurements to a central receiving device via various wireless or wired technologies. The processing unit is programmed to encrypt data and provide it with a digital signature to prevent tampering and fraud. The invention can be implemented in either software or hardware, and multiple components may be represented by the same item of hardware.

In summary, this patent describes a highly innovative current sensor system for electricity metering that offers immunity to magnetic interference, precision, scalability, and communication capabilities. It forms the basis for a complete polyphase electricity meter, including a processing device for data analysis, storage, and reporting, as well as optional preprocessing units and wireless or wired communication capabilities. The system is designed to meet requirements such as defined geometry of current circuit connections, multiple adjacent independent sensors, immunity to external AC field, low cost, wide dynamic range, good linearity, and immunity to DC magnetic field.","[{'document': 'EP 1553420 A'}, {'document': 'WO 0186670 A'}, {'document': 'WO 9732217 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2005103737 A'}, {'document': 'CH 358157 A'}, {'document': 'US 5124642 A'}, {'document': 'US 6414475 B1'}, {'document': 'US 6734661 B2'}]","[{'document': 'US 6414475 B'}, {'document': 'US 6734661 B'}]",[],WO2007085278,"['AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'NL', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'TR']",[],[],"7,9","– Goal 7: The patent describes a ""watthour electricity meter"" which contributes to ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

insulin pumps, apheresis systems, and drug delivery pumps. This system facilitates secure remote configuration of these devices, ensuring safe access through new authorization protocols. It enables simultaneous operation and data set distribution without interrupting the device's activity.

The primary purpose of this technology is to improve patient safety by reducing medication errors. The system distributes data sets like drug libraries that provide instructions for correct medication administration. It can interact with various medical devices, integrate with electronic medical records, and send out updates even when the device is in use.

The system includes a method for identifying and distributing unique data sets to specific devices based on predefined policies. Safety measures such as hard limits prevent clinicians from programming smart pumps outside predetermined dose or rate parameters for high-risk drugs like heparin. The system also generates usage reports regarding drug administration, dose overrides, and device usage.

The system is computerized, with a user interface that includes various output devices and a communication device for exchanging data with external machines via a network. It stores coded instructions representing flow diagrams in mass storage devices or volatile/non-volatile memory, which can be updated to provide new or updated data sets to medical devices.

The system links medical devices, locations, and policies, allowing it to send out data sets and receive status based on the associated policy. If a policy does not apply to a device, it will not receive the information from the system. The pharmacy controls the data set distribution, and the end user must accept the data set to continue using the device.

The patent also includes a computer-implemented method for medical device management, which involves comparing a first and second data set identification, triggering a download if they don't match, activating the new data set when the device is idle, and facilitating operation according to the new data set. The system can program the medical device with the new data set and trigger notifications following programming. It may also create a distribution policy to distribute the new data set to one or more medical devices.

The secondary data set often includes a drug library for the pump, ensuring that it always has the most up-to-date medication information. If an update fails to activate, the device may be disabled as a safety measure. The system's primary innovation lies in its ability to automatically update the device's data sets when a mismatch is detected between two identifications, typically during a device idle state.","[{'document': 'WO 2013059615 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2004070548 A2'}, {'document': 'US 2004176984 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2013104120 A1'}, {'document': 'HOSPIRA MEDNET: ""System operating manual Hospira Mednet Plum A+"", 1 February 2013 (2013-02-01), XP093114659, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://www.icumed.com/media/9566/plum_aplus_with_hospira_mednet_software.pdf> [retrieved on 20231221]'}]",[{'document': 'WO 2013059615 A1'}],[],,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""computerimplemented method for medical device management"" that includes ""administering an injection to a subject by the medical device according to the target data set"", directly contributing to health and well-being.",Physics,Computing & Data Processing,"Fenwal, Inc.",US,1,"MOSKAL, Witold; WROBLEWSKI, Maciej",US,2,

like the oral cavity. The key innovation is a copolymer consisting of two types of monomeric units: one with a hydrophobic group and another with a carboxyl or carboxylic anhydride group. This copolymer provides sufficient water resistance, good compatibility with resins, and high adhesion strength even in humid conditions.

The adhesive coating material includes a polymerizable vinyl compound, organic peroxide and amine as radical initiators, sulfinic acid salt or carboxylic acid salt as promoters, optional organic titanate, and an optional stabilizer for the organic titanate. The combination of these components results in an adhesive that can bond directly to hard tissues without pretreatment and has a high adhesive force to both hard tissue and dental resinous restorative materials.

The polymer's acid value should be between 30 and 700, with a preferred range of 40 to 600. The hydrophobic group can be various aryl, alkyl, alkoxy, or acryloxy groups. The adhesive coating material is particularly suitable for dental applications, improving the bond between hard tissues and dental resinous restorative materials, such as composite resins, especially in humid conditions.

The copolymerization process involves using a polymerization initiator, such as organic peroxides, azo compounds, or metal compounds. The resulting copolymer can be further hydrolyzed to form carboxylic acid ester groups or carboxylic anhydride groups. When an organic titanate compound is used in the adhesive coating material, a stabilizer for the organic titanate compound is preferred to ensure stability, especially when water-containing solvents are used.

The adhesive coating material demonstrates high adhesiveness to hard tissue and dental resinous restorative materials, making it suitable for various dental applications such as tooth adhesives, protective linings for dental pulp, border sealers for teeth, and restorative materials. The patent also addresses issues with conventional methods that involve damage to healthy tissue or the risk of pulp damage due to residual monomers or high concentrations of phosphoric acid.

The primary technical innovation lies in the use of a copolymer containing both hydrophobic groups (such as styrene) and carboxyl or carboxylic anhydride groups, which improves the material's water resistance and adhesive force under humid oral cavity conditions.

The key technical innovation involves using specific silica xerogels, precipitates, and aluminosilicate salts as abrasives in clear toothpastes due to their appropriate abrasive, organoleptic, and optical properties.

The patent proposes a novel humectant system for clear gel toothpaste that reduces the need for closely matching refractive indices between abrasives and humectants, allowing more water content in the paste. The primary humectant is low maltitol hydrogenated hydrolyzed polysaccharides (polyols) prepared by partially hydrolyzing a polysaccharide consisting of chains of glucose residues and then hydrogenating the resulting hydrolyzate. These polyols provide a clear gel toothpaste with improved texture compared to previous formulations, while being less costly than glycerine, sorbitol, or high maltitol content hydrogenated starch hydrolyzate.

The invention also addresses the problem of slumping in clear gel dentifrices by incorporating polyethylene glycol of appropriate molecular weight into the dentifrice to improve shortness of texture. The patent describes a method for producing hydrogenated oligosaccharides from starch sources (e.g., corn, potatoes) through hydrolysis and hydrogenation.

The toothpaste composition includes 20 to 70% by weight of these humectant solids, 5 to 50% by weight of an abrasive, and water. The polyols contain less than 40% DP (DP1), not more than 30% of DP2, 30 to 60% of DP3 to DPg, and 20 to 30% of DP10 or higher.

The patent offers improved structural properties and desirable characteristics such as shortness of texture and high cohesion for toothpastes containing these new humectants. The clarity of the toothpaste is determined by a specific method involving a Teflon gasket and a translucency reading. Additional ingredients such as binders, thickeners, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavors, surfactants, buffers, germicides, antibiotics, astringents, and fluoride compounds can be added to the toothpaste composition for various purposes.

The unexpected result is that at a concentration of 70%, the new humectants yield substantially clearer toothpaste than sorbitol, despite little difference in refractive index. The proposed explanation for this phenomenon is that the silica abrasive particles are porous structures with finite-sized pores and reactive surfaces. When contacted with an aqueous polyol solution, water and lower molecular weight polyols (like sorbitol) freely enter into the porous silica, while higher hydrogenated oligosaccharides tend to be excluded.

The patent includes examples demonstrating the effectiveness of the new humectants in maintaining clarity in toothpaste formulations, as well as tests showing that the polyols can also be applied to clear dentifrices comprising a precipitated amorphous silica abrasive material. The method for testing cohesion of toothpaste is also described, focusing on maintaining a specific temperature range (21-27°C) during testing.","[{'document': 'FR 2502495 A'}, {'document': 'GB 2100983 A'}, {'document': 'US 4357314 A'}]",[],[],,"['AT', 'BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'FR', 'GB', 'IT', 'LI', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""dentifrice composition"" for ""cleaning and polishing teeth"", which directly contributes to oral health and well-being.

The main objective is to retrieve intrinsic parameters such as reflectivity and specific attenuation from an environment using radars operating at various frequencies that result in attenuation. This is achieved by simultaneously observing events with different radars located in diverse positions within the environment, and solving a relationship between the intrinsic parameter values, measured values, and attenuation to retrieve the intrinsic parameter values.

The methods involve operating a radar network, generating respective radar beams with each of multiple radars, determining the respective measured reflectivity along each radar beam's path, and calculating an intrinsic reflectivity for different volume elements within the environment. In some cases, the intrinsic reflectivity is determined by identifying the different volume elements and finding an extremum (often a local minimum) of a cost function defined in terms of the estimate of the intrinsic reflectivity for each volume element.

The primary applications of these methods are in weather forecasting and monitoring, flood prediction and management, precipitation analysis for agricultural, hydrological, and meteorological purposes, disaster response and emergency management, air traffic control, military surveillance, and remote sensing of environmental conditions in various industries. The patent also includes a description of a weathercasting system that creates dynamic 3D pictorial representations of weather conditions using meteorological data combined with geographical and topographical data.

The networked radar evaluation system can be deployed on cellular-telephone towers or moving vehicles, allowing for repeated measurements when at least one radar's physical position may be moved. The system includes a communications device, storage device, processor, and memory, designed to determine intrinsic parameters (reflectivity or specific attenuation) of an environment from received data using the described methods.

To address potential inaccuracies due to differences in radar beam shapes, the method involves constructing volume elements with substantially equal volumes by selecting appropriate heights for the frustroconical elements. The patent also addresses potential inaccuracies due to variations in range resolution and pointing mismatch by adjusting the reflectivity at common volumes. Simulations have been performed to evaluate the accuracy of the methods, demonstrating good consistency among the different radars despite small differences attributable to these factors.

The patent's main advantage is its insensitivity to calibration errors, which is an unexpected advantage in weather radar systems for accurate weather monitoring and prediction.

presents an innovative hybrid agricultural vehicle, integrating both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric motor for powering the vehicle and its components, such as mechanical implements and electric tools. The system comprises an ICE, a drivetrain, an electric machine (motor), energy storage means (battery), and various control units like an Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) algorithm, power distribution unit, inverter, and cooling system.

The electric machine can operate in two modes: generator mode, where it generates electricity to charge the battery or power electric implements when the vehicle's power requirements are low; and motor mode, where it uses stored energy from the battery to generate mechanical power for driving components and electric implements when the power requirements exceed a predefined threshold.

The ECMS algorithm determines when to switch between modes based on the vehicle's power needs, aiming to minimize fuel consumption, emissions, and noise levels while providing a sustainable and cost-effective solution without requiring dedicated recharging infrastructure on farms. The primary application of this system is in work vehicles such as tractors or construction equipment where high-power tasks (requiring ICE) and low-power tasks (suitable for EM) are common.

The hybrid architecture enables increased efficiency by using the appropriate power source for each task, reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The vehicle includes a finite-state logic for detecting various faults and a thermal management system to monitor cooling fluid temperatures, adjusting the pump and fan accordingly. Modifications can be made within the scope defined by the patent claims.

In vineyard or orchard applications where space constraints require a compact design, this hybrid vehicle can maintain its overall volume while benefiting from partial electrification without requiring dedicated infrastructure for charging the energy storage system. Additionally, the cooling system helps control temperatures of the electric machine and inverter during operation, minimizing potential damage or malfunctions. The absence of a flywheel is another advantage due to the similar functionality provided by the combination of the electric machine and energy storage system.","[{'document': 'WO 2007053629 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2008042319 A2'}, {'document': 'US 2007227801 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2009018716 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2018072252 A1'}]","[{'document': 'US 20180072252 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2009018716 A'}]",[],,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'ME', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],7,"– Goal 7: The patent describes a ""work vehicle 1 comprising an internal combustion engine 2...and electric machine 3...and electric energy storage means 4"" which can improve energy efficiency and increase the share of renewable energy.",Performing Operations & Transport,Transportation & Vehicles,CNH Industrial Italia S.p.A.,IT,1,"Fiorati, Stefano; Lenzini, Nicola; Traversi, Andrea",IT,3,

The lactic acid units in the polylactic acid should be 90-100 mol%, with a more preferred range of 95-100 mol% and a further more preferred range of 98-100 mol%.

The PLA-based resin content in the composition is preferably 20-100 wt%, with a more preferred range of 30-99.5 wt% and an even more preferred range of 50-99 wt%. The composition may also contain plasticizers, block copolymer type plasticizers, thermoplastic resins other than PLA, and various particles and additives as required.

The patent provides guidelines for the content of these additional components, with preferred ranges for each. For example, the preferred content of the thermoplastic resin is 0.1-400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the PLA-based resin. The preferred total content of the buffering agent is 0.05-500 moles per ton of the PLA-based composition, with a more preferred range of 0.08-300 moles and an even more preferred range of 0.1-100 mol/t.

The carboxyl group reactive end capping agent is added to further enhance hydrolysis resistance by synergistic action with the buffering agent. The amount of the carboxyl group reactive end capping agent added is preferably between 0.01 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the PLA-based resin, with a more preferred range being 0.05 to 5 parts and a further more preferred range being 0.1 to 2 parts.

The hydrolysis resistance of the resulting PLA-based compositions can be evaluated using methods such as forced film deterioration (non-oriented, oriented films, and inflation films) and measuring the breaking strength of a film in the longitudinal direction. The breaking strength holding rate is used to evaluate the hydrolysis resistance, with higher rates indicating better resistance.

The patent provides examples demonstrating the effectiveness of the method described, including the production of biaxially oriented films, specifically inflatable films, made from a combination of PLA-based resins and other additives. The primary application of these films is for inflatable products due to their improved hydrolysis resistance. The invention's industrial applicability lies in the production of various molded PLA-based articles that require hydrolysis resistance, such as packaging materials, medical devices, or inflatable products.","[{'document': 'EP 1876205 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2008102919 A1'}, {'document': 'JP 2003113247 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2006328222 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2007138062 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2007269019 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2008156616 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2008296123 A'}, {'document': 'US 5703160 A'}, {'document': 'US 2005001358 A1'}, {'document': 'DATABASE WPI Week 200735 Thomson Scientific, London, GB; AN 2007-368138 XP002690178, & JP 2007 099939 A (MUSASHINO CHEM LAB LTD) 19 April 2007 (2007-04-19)'}, {'document': 'DATABASE WPI Week 200424 Thomson Scientific, London, GB; AN 2004-250163 XP002690179, -& JP 2003 321602 A (TORAY IND INC) 14 November 2003 (2003-11-14)'}, {'document': 'DATABASE WPI Week 200541 Thomson Scientific, London, GB; AN 2005-398760 XP002690180, -& JP 2005 139280 A (TORAY IND INC) 2 June 2005 (2005-06-02)'}]","[{'document': 'JP 7316273 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2007291336 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2008007750 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2003321602 A'}]",[],WO2009119336,"['AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'TR']",[],[],12,"– Goal 12: The patent describes a ""polylactic acidbased composition"", which contributes to responsible consumption and production by promoting the use of biodegradable materials.

The key technical innovation lies in the development of a stable NaSSA-containing transdermal patch that addresses issues related to side effects and blood level control in oral preparations.

The patch consists of a support layer, a drug-containing layer with mirtazapine or its salts, and a release liner. The drug-containing layer is formulated using a matrix-type adhesive layer containing the active ingredient and a nonaqueous adhesive ingredient, which facilitates easy manufacturing and cost reduction compared to traditional patches.

To enhance transdermal absorption, various promoters such as alkanolamines, fatty acids or their esters, and specific compounds like myristates, menthol, and Polysorbate 80™ are incorporated into the patch. An antioxidant like ascorbic acid is also added to prevent the formation of certain substances derived from NaSSA.

The patent provides examples of additional ingredients that can be included in the patch for various purposes, such as plasticizers, crosslinking agents, colorants, or UV absorbents. The support layer can be made from synthetic resin films, porous substances, foams, papers, woven fabrics, or nonwoven fabrics.

The production methods involve dissolving the active ingredient, tackifier, and optional transdermal absorption promoter in an organic solvent, spreading this solution onto a release liner or support, and evaporating the solvent to form a drug-containing layer. Alternatively, the active ingredient and tackifier can be melted under heat and spread onto the release liner or support.

The primary application of these transdermal patches is for delivering mirtazapine through the skin for therapeutic purposes, potentially reducing side effects associated with oral preparations. A drug permeation test was conducted to measure the steady-state transdermal permeation rate of mirtazapine, with results ranging from 13.0 to 25.1 µg/cm2/hr for various formulations.

The patent also includes a kinetic study in rat blood, which shows that the transdermal patches can secure an increase in neurotransmitters (NA, DA, and 5-HT) levels in the rat prefrontal region, confirming its promotional effect on these neurotransmitters. The inclusion of antioxidants like ascorbyl palmitate, dibutylhydroxytoluene, and isoascorbic acid significantly retards the formation of related substances in the patches over time.

In summary, this invention offers a novel transdermal patch for the treatment of depression that provides sustained and effective drug delivery, potentially reducing side effects associated with oral preparations.","[{'document': 'EP 2233158 A2'}, {'document': 'WO 2009041122 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2009055860 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2010126124 A1'}, {'document': 'JP 2005510488 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2009531452 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2010163367 A'}]","[{'document': 'JP 2005510488 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2009055860 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2010126124 A1'}, {'document': 'JP 2010163367 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2009041122 A1'}, {'document': 'JP 2009531452 A'}, {'document': 'EP 2233158 A2'}, {'document': 'JP 2006335714 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2007284378 A'}]",[],WO2012077651,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant-containing transdermal patch"", which directly contributes to mental health and well-being.",Human Necessities,Medical & Healthcare,"Yutoku Pharmaceutical Industries Co., Ltd.",JP,1,"YOSHITAKE, Makoto; OGAWA, Takayuki; YOSHITAKE, Takashi","JP, SE",3,

an innovative, non-invasive system for determining the viability of eggs in an incubation process. The system is designed to be integrated into an incubator, eliminating the need for transporting eggs for candling and reducing potential contamination. The core technology involves a tester unit that uses light scattering measurements from above or below the eggs to determine their viability.

The system operates in real-time by focusing on certain value occurrence patterns within the first formant band of human speech, such as differential first formant pitch, rate of change of pitch, duration, and time distribution patterns. These factors are indicative of both transient and long-term emotional states.

The device comprises several key components: a zero axis limiter, pulse generator, low pass filter (FM demodulator), word detector circuit, differentiator circuit, full wave rectifier circuit, pulse stretching circuit, output circuit with comparator and display, and an optional tactile device for physical stimulation.

The FM demodulated output signal from the low pass filter is applied to a word detector circuit, which switches on when the reference level (250 Hz) is exceeded by the FM demodulated signal. The differentiator circuit produces an output signal proportional to the instantaneous rate of change of frequency of the first formant speech signal.

The signal from the differentiator is then processed through a full wave rectifier and pulse stretching circuit, eliminating false null information as the differentiated signal passes through zero. The output of the pulse stretching circuit is evaluated by a comparator circuit, triggering visual or tactile indicators based on the amplitude level of the output signal.

The system's portability makes it suitable for various applications, including criminal investigations, medical/psychiatric diagnostics, public opinion polling, and more. The patent differentiates itself from previous techniques by operating on real-time frequency components within the first formant band, providing a more sensitive analysis of emotional stress compared to existing methods.

and certain microorganisms like gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and fungi. The peptide is represented by formula (I), with different substitutions for R1 to R5. The patent outlines methods for synthesizing these new peptides using various activation methods for carboxy groups, a wide range of solvents and conditions, and appropriate acylating agents and condensing agents based on the specific compounds used.

The primary compound of interest is L-Lys(E-Z)-D-AlaOH (3), synthesized from D-AlaOH (2) and Boc-L-Lys(E-Z)OSU (1). The process involves dissolving starting compounds in a mixture of water, dioxane, and triethylamine, followed by filtration, acidification, extraction, drying, and purification through HP20 column chromatography.

The synthesized peptides can be administered in various forms such as tablets, capsules, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or liquid form. They may potentially be used in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, material science, drug development, vaccine design, or research on protein structure and function due to the nature of peptides as bioactive molecules.

The patent also describes the synthesis of specific peptide derivatives, primarily focusing on octanoyl-, stearoyl-, and longer-chain fatty acid esters of D-Ala-D-Glu dipeptides with L-Lys or L-mesoDAP at the N-terminus.

for determining the repair length of cracks in structures like bridges using captured images. The technology involves an image processing system that automatically detects, distinguishes, and measures cracks, creating interpolation curves to represent repair regions. This approach enhances the accuracy of repair material usage, reducing waste and improving the efficiency of repair processes.

The bridge structure described in the patent is a reinforced concrete design consisting of a main girder, cross beams, cross frames, lateral frames, and a deck slab. The system can be applied to various structures such as tunnels, buildings, roads, etc., in addition to bridges.

The image processing system includes a digital camera (imaging apparatus) and a system main body (repair length determination apparatus). It combines multiple images for better analysis, detects cracks using wavelet analysis, displays them with different visual indicators based on their width, and allows users to create interpolation curves by pointing multiple positions along the crack. The system also includes a filtering step to delete non-repair-target cracks from the display if necessary.

The key technical innovation lies in the automatic pointing of multiple points along a crack, which can be done at equal intervals, based on connecting portions with different widths of cracks, or through user operation. After automatic pointing, interpolation curves are created to represent repair regions. These interpolation curves can be spline or Bezier curves and are used to approximate the actual crack. Users can adjust pointed positions if necessary for improved accuracy.

The system outputs the results in various formats like CAD diagrams or CSV files for further use, and allows for sorting interpolation curves based on the width of the crack, making it easier to manage cracks of different sizes. The primary application of this technology is in the inspection and repair of concrete structures such as bridges, but it has potential uses in other applications involving crack detection and repair.","[{'document': 'CN 103667797 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2001124522 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2016090548 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2016099235 A'}, {'document': 'JP H01195351 A'}, {'document': 'US 2013044936 A1'}, {'document': 'US 6711284 B1'}, {'document': 'GARCÍA G L ET AL: ""Cavitation resistance of epoxy-based multilayer coatings: Surface damage and crack growth kinetics during the incubation stage"", WEAR, vol. 316, no. 1, 2014 - 2014, pages 124 - 132, XP028851933, ISSN: 0043-1648, DOI: 10.1016/J.WEAR.2014.04.007'}]","[{'document': 'JP 2016099235 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2016090548 A'}, {'document': 'US 6711284 B1'}, {'document': 'CN 103667797'}, {'document': 'JP 4006007 B'}, {'document': 'GARCIA G.L. et al.

The key innovation lies in the design of the electrolytic cell, which retains coarse particles of the concentrate near the anode while separating insoluble impurities released during electrolysis as fine particles at the bottom of the cell. This design eliminates the need for expensive chemical plants typically required in previous methods.

The process involves adding more concentrate to the cell, removing solid impurities from the cell bottom, and evaporating water produced during electrolysis. The metal recovery is maintained by dissolving the metal values from the solid concentrate below solution level, with the acidity of the electrolyte not rising due to immediate H+ ion reactions with the concentrate.

The patent also includes an electrolytic cell design that incorporates at least one grid for isolating the concentrate from the cathode, allowing insoluble impurities to accumulate in the bottom of the cell and be removed periodically or continuously. A low-pressure air or mechanical stirrer system is used for agitating the concentrate during electrolysis, with a pH probe activating a high-pressure air blower when the pH falls below a pre-set value or on a time basis by a cam controller. The pH of the electrolyte is regulated to maintain an optimum value in the anode and cathode compartments, depending on the metal being recovered and the electrolyte used.

The cell, often triangular in cross-section, is constructed from ebonite-lined mild steel plate with two lateral rows of anodes and a central row of cathodes. The anode and cathode compartments are separated by substantially vertical grids. In operation, the cell is filled with electrolyte and concentrate placed in the anode compartments. Electrolysis starts, causing hydrogen ions to release metal values that dissolve and migrate to the cathodes. Fine impurities released in the anode compartments pass through the grid and sink to the bottom for removal.

The patent provides a schematic diagram of a nickel recovery cell as an example, featuring an elongated tapering body with two lateral sides that converge towards the bottom, three spaced bus-bars supported above the container, connected to a rectified source of electrical energy, and graphite anodes and etched nickel cathodes suspended from these bus-bars, separated by vertical grids. The cell is periodically dosed with a flocculating agent, and air is drawn across the surface of the electrolyte to remove water vapor generated by the hot electrolyte.

In summary, this patent presents an innovative system for recovering metals like nickel using electrolysis cells equipped with low-pressure air or mechanical stirrers, pH control, and specific cell design features. The primary application is in the recovery of nickel values from concentrate.",[],[],[],,"['BE', 'CH', 'DE', 'FR', 'GB', 'IT', 'LU', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],12,"– Goal 12: The patent describes ""a process for electrolytically recovering metal values from a solid concentrate"", which directly relates to improving resource efficiency and waste reduction.",Chemistry & Metallurgy,Chemical Processes,,,0,"Cannell, John Frederick",GB,1,

manufacturing energy-efficient insulating building products, primarily designed for houses and buildings requiring thermal and/or acoustic insulation. The traditional approach involves constructing walls with bricks, applying insulating panels, and either attaching another brick wall or pouring expandable insulating material between the walls.

The new method streamlines this process by eliminating the need for mechanical hooking members like small metal springs, which were associated with increased production costs, complexity, and accuracy requirements. Instead, it employs expansion inserts that extend through cavities in both the brick blocks and insulating panels, providing a stable connection between them. This simplification reduces costs, improves efficiency, and minimizes accuracy requirements during assembly.

The patent covers both the method of manufacturing the insulating building product and the product itself, which consists of two brick blocks with an interposed insulating material (e.g., foamed polystyrene). The expansion inserts are used to securely connect the brick blocks to the insulating material without additional mechanical hooking members.

The primary application of this invention is in the construction industry, where it can be utilized to build cost-effective and energy-efficient walls for houses and buildings. The insulating building product offers optimal thermal and soundproofing features while maintaining structural simplicity and reduced costs compared to traditional methods.

The manufacturing process involves placing the blocks and insulating element on a conveyor belt, drilling the cavities, inserting the expansion inserts, and cooling to solidify them. The invention simplifies the structure of the building product, reduces costs, and offers a quick and simple manufacturing process with minimal accuracy requirements during assembly. The expansion inserts are made of a plastic material, such as polypropylene or silicone, which can be inserted into the cavity while in a pasty or semifluid state and then expanded and hardened within the cavity, ensuring a steady engagement between the blocks and insulating element.","[{'document': 'DE 102006021513 A1'}, {'document': 'DE 29617495 U1'}]","[{'document': 'EP 1085137 A'}, {'document': 'DE 29617495 U1'}, {'document': 'DE 102006021513 A1'}]",[],,"['AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MT', 'NL', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'TR']","['AL', 'BA', 'HR', 'RS']",[],"9,11","– Goal 9: The patent describes a ""building product for buildings"" that improves the infrastructure of buildings.

The process involves creating an unsupported, collapsible cavity at the terminus of a borehole within or adjacent to the coal seam. This cavity is designed to fracture and convert adsorbed methane into free form methane, which can then be recovered via the borehole.

The method achieves this by generating pulsating pressure effects within the cavity through vibrations or blasting, causing the walls of the cavity to collapse and facilitating the recovery of methane. The recovered methane can be utilized for various purposes such as burning, liquefying, compressing, storing, cleaning, or directing into pipelines.

In addition to improving methane recovery efficiency, this technique also relieves stress in the coal seam, making it easier to mine the coal after the collapse of the walls and the surrounding area. By applying this method to an entire coal seam, a demethanated and stress-relieved coal seam is created, facilitating easier mining.

The depth and radius of the cavity are determined by factors such as overburden pressure and coal type (bright or dull).

The core technology involves a unique three-shaft system (engine shaft, first motor shaft, and third shaft) with a second motor and four connection/disconnection modules that manage the connections between the shafts.

The apparatus includes a control module that optimizes power output to the drive shaft based on its rotation speed. In low rotation ranges, power is output by connecting the second motor to the third shaft and connecting the drive shaft to the third shaft. In high rotation ranges, power is output by connecting the second motor to the engine shaft and connecting the drive shaft to the third shaft.

The patent proposes a smooth switching mechanism between these states using a first coupled rotating mechanism synchronized with the engine shaft's rotation speed. The switching operation occurs when the first motor's shaft reaches a specific rotation speed.

The power distribution and integration mechanism is a planetary gear setup with a sun gear, ring gear, and carrier. The crankshaft of the engine is connected to the carrier, while the rotating shafts of both motors are connected to the sun gear and ring gear, respectively.

Connection/disconnection mechanisms allow for coupling or decoupling the electric motor's rotating shaft with the first coupled rotating shaft, the engine crankshaft, the second coupled rotating shaft, and the drive shaft. The dog clutch design is used in these mechanisms.

belt system designed for draper headers in agricultural machines like combines. The system allows operators to momentarily reverse the direction of lateral belts to dislodge accumulated crop material without leaving the cab, enhancing efficiency during harvesting operations.

The key technical innovations include an automated control system with a proportional flow control valve and a directional flow control valve. The proportional valve adjusts fluid flow rate, while the directional valve switches the fluid path to reverse the rotation of the conveyors.

The system operates by delivering hydraulic fluid through a fluid line in a forward direction during harvesting operations, with the directional flow control valve maintained in a first state. To dislodge crop material wedged in the laterally extending conveyor belts, the directional flow control valve is switched to a second state, reversing the fluid direction.

The primary application of this system is in agricultural machines, specifically combines and draper headers used for harvesting fluffy or bushy crops such as soybeans or canola. The patent describes various versions of the system, including one using a piston pump instead of a gear pump, and optional components like an electric starter motor or solenoid to cause momentary reverse rotation of the conveyor belts.

The operational steps are performed by a controller upon loading and executing software code stored on a tangible computer-readable medium, with the primary application being for dislodging accumulated crop material from conveyors during operation in agricultural machinery.","[{'document': 'US 4522018 A'}, {'document': 'US 5086613 A'}, {'document': 'US 5778644 A'}, {'document': 'US 2010251682 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2014096497 A1'}]","[{'document': 'US 9144197 B'}, {'document': 'US 2010251682 A1'}, {'document': 'US 4522018 A'}]",[],WO2021081270,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],2,"– Goal 2: The patent relates to an ""agricultural machine"" and aims to dislodge crop material, which can improve the efficiency and yield of harvesting, contributing to sustainable food production systems.",Human Necessities,Agriculture & Forestry,CNH Industrial Belgium NV,BE,1,"RICKETTS, Jonathan; FARLEY, Herbert; TROWBRIDGE, Jeffrey",US,3,

The toothbrush head is constructed as a unitary structure with elastomeric elements that allow for independent movement of rotatable tooth cleaning elements (tufts), addressing issues of optimal penetration between teeth during brushing. The head features a split or opening for water flow through, promoting better cleanability.

The patent offers two main embodiments: one with tufts secured by ball and socket type arrangements, and another with tufts rotating within recessed sections. Despite some limitations in contact with teeth during brushing or random orientation of the tufts after use, these designs offer a unique solution to traditional toothbrush design.

The manufacturing process involves injection molding and a hot-tufting process to secure the tufts into the head, followed by heating and compression to achieve the final shape. The toothbrush head incorporates multiple groups of tufts made from different materials and bristle sizes for various cleaning functions, arranged in a specific pattern on the head. A unique feature is the pivoting tufts that can move up to 15 degrees to better access different areas of the mouth.

In addition to traditional bristles, the patent suggests alternative tooth cleaning elements such as elastomeric fins made of thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). These fins feature a textured surface with ribs that enhance oral cavity cleaning, improving the effectiveness of toothbrushing. The primary application for this innovative design is in personal oral hygiene products, specifically electric or manual toothbrushes intended for daily use by consumers. Alternative textured surfaces, such as dimples, can also be used instead of ribs to further improve efficiency and user experience.","[{'document': 'WO 0238004 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 9901054 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 0076369 A2'}, {'document': 'US 5735011 A'}, {'document': 'US 6108851 A'}]","[{'document': 'WO 0076369 A'}, {'document': 'JP 3312978 A'}, {'document': 'US 6058541 A'}, {'document': 'US 6018840 A'}, {'document': 'US 4635313 A'}, {'document': 'US 6361120 B'}, {'document': 'GB 2330791 A'}, {'document': 'EP 676268 A1'}]",[{'publication_number': '1603426'}],,"['AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IT', 'LI', 'LU', 'MC', 'NL', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The toothbrush head contributes to ""achieving universal health coverage"", specifically related to oral health.

dilatation of various anatomical passageways within the ear, nose, throat, and paranasal sinuses. The primary innovation involves the use of expandable balloons for dilating these passageways, which can be precisely positioned using guide wires, catheters, and in some cases, illuminating guidewires for proper position confirmation before inflation.

Two main methods are presented: one for remodeling bone adjacent to ostia (e.g., paranasal sinuses) by inflating an expandable balloon within the targeted ostium; another for Eustachian tube dilation, achieved by inserting a dilation catheter or other instrument into the Eustachian tube and inflating it for improved ventilation and drainage.

Image-guided surgery techniques are also discussed, including real-time correlation of surgical instruments with preoperatively obtained images using systems like the CARTO® 3 System by Biosense-Webster, Inc., providing surgeons with precise positioning information even in difficult visualization scenarios.

The patent introduces an adjustable dilation instrument that includes a handle assembly, guide shaft assembly, guidewire actuation assembly, and dilation catheter actuation assembly. This instrument can be adjusted to expand and dilate targeted passageways, such as paranasal sinuses or Eustachian tubes. The guide shaft assembly has a flexible shaft member, push-pull wire, cam barrel, and deflection control knob for guiding the guidewire and dilation catheter along an operator-selected exit angle.

A key technical innovation is a compact endoscope system that allows simultaneous use with a dilation catheter within a guide lumen, without requiring the endoscope head to vacate the guide lumen during dilation. This design involves a dilator that pushes the distal head of the endoscope into a clearance opening, allowing the dilation catheter to pass alongside the endoscope.

The patent also describes an endoscope with enlargeable tail end and suction and irrigation openings positioned on opposing sides of the elongate endoscope body, enabling compactness of the distal head for smooth sliding of the dilator without deflecting it. The system can be reconditioned for reuse after at least one use, with versions processed before surgery through cleaning, sterilization, and storage in a sealed container.

In summary, this patent presents a comprehensive solution for medical procedures requiring both visual examination and dilation, offering improved techniques for dilating various anatomical passageways using expandable balloons, guide wires, catheters, and image-guided surgery systems. The compact endoscope system allows simultaneous imaging and dilation, making it applicable in interventional radiology, cardiology, and other medical procedures requiring such capabilities.","[{'document': 'EP 2502550 A2'}, {'document': 'WO 2015110996 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2016040237 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2016138128 A1'}, {'document': 'CN 104546036 A'}, {'document': 'CN 106943114 A'}, {'document': 'US 2007249896 A1'}]","[{'document': 'US 20110004057 A 20110106'}, {'document': 'US 20100274188 A 20101028'}, {'document': 'US 20130274715 A 20131017'}, {'document': 'US 9155492 B 20151013'}, {'document': 'US 20140364725 A 20141211'}, {'document': 'US 93373718 20180323'}, {'document': 'US 20180310886 A'}, {'document': 'CN 106943114 A'}, {'document': 'US 03247118 20180711'}, {'document': 'US 20190015645 A'}, {'document': 'US 03248918 20180711'}, {'document': 'US 20190015646 A'}]",[],WO2020115686,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""surgical instrument"" with integral imaging and irrigation features, directly contributing to medical technology and healthcare.",Human Necessities,Medical & Healthcare; Other Human Necessities,"Acclarent, Inc.; Biosense Webster (Israel) Ltd.","US, IL",2,"AKBARIAN, Fatemeh; ALGAWI, Yehuda; FANG, Itzhak; PALUSHI, Jetmir; PAPADAKIS, Athanasios; SALAZAR, Henry F.; SHAMELI, Ehsan","US, IL",7,

The system features a locking mechanism to prevent accidental connection of the cartridge housing to the injector due to non-corresponding threaded profiles. Activation is achieved by twisting and pushing the cartridge housing towards the vial, causing the needle to pierce both septa (vial and cartridge) and establish fluid communication.

A locking member or ring prevents accidental removal of the stopper from the cartridge during use and accidental pulling out when the plunger rod is pulled out. This ensures safety and proper functioning of the drug reconstitution system. The system also includes a ratchet mechanism for releasing the slider when sufficient rotational force is applied, providing torque resistance to prevent accidental movement during use.

The design incorporates safety features such as preventing attachment of a pen needle until a specific adapter component (needle adapter) has been transferred to the cartridge holder, and disposing of the device without exposing the needle. The system allows for one-handed shaking for mixing and observation of fluid level through a viewing window on the cartridge housing.

In summary, this patent presents an advanced drug reconstitution system that aims to improve safety, reduce waste, and simplify processes in medical devices. Its primary application is in pharmaceutical applications where drugs need to be reconstituted before administration, particularly for insulin pens or similar injection systems. The system ensures proper mixing of substances before use and prevents accidental injection of pre-reconstituted compositions.","[{'document': 'EP 1541185 A1'}, {'document': 'US 3835835 A'}]","[{'document': 'EP 1541185 A'}, {'document': 'US 3835835 A'}]",[],WO2013134614,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent describes a ""DRUG RECONSTITUTION SYSTEM"", which directly contributes to ensuring access to essential medicines.",Human Necessities,Other Human Necessities,"Becton, Dickinson and Company",US,1,"CRONENBERG, Richard; WU, Haiming",US,2,

cancer.",,"This patent introduces a novel method for detecting colorectal cancer, focusing on the analysis of genomic DNA sequences with altered expression patterns in disease states compared to normal. The primary target genes associated with colon carcinomas include Septin 9, RASSF2, and others. The key innovation is the use of bisulfite modification of DNA to analyze the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides within these genes, which can be detected using standard molecular biological techniques such as amplification, hybridization, or sequencing.

The patent presents several diagnostic tools and methods, including the ""HeavyMethyl™ MethyLight™"" assay, MSP (methylation-specific PCR), COBRA (Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis), microarray technology for gene expression analysis, immunoassays, and western blot analysis. These methods aim to improve current screening methods by increasing sensitivity, specificity, ease of use, and reducing costs.

The primary application of this technology is in the field of medical diagnostics, specifically for the detection, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and treatment/monitoring of colorectal cell proliferative disorders. The method can determine the presence or absence of colorectal carcinoma by analyzing the methylation status of a target sequence containing at least one CpG position.

The patent also discloses methods for ascertaining genetic and/or epigenetic parameters of the genomic sequence within a subject by analyzing cytosine methylation and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Kits containing a bisulfite reagent, primer oligonucleotides, and instructions for use are provided for the diagnosis of cellular proliferative disorders.

By detecting hypermethylation of the RASSF2 gene associated with colorectal carcinomas, this method offers improved means for early detection of colorectal cell proliferative disorders, contributing to better treatment outcomes. The potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes for colorectal carcinoma is significant, as it may enable earlier detection and treatment, improving the overall poor prognosis of patients.","[{'document': 'WO 2005123945 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2006008128 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2006113466 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2007008693 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2007009755 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2007039234 A'}, {'document': 'HESSON L B ET AL: ""CpG island promoter hypermethylation of a novel Ras-effector gene RASSF2A is an arly event in colon carcinogenesis and correlates inversely with K-ras mutations"" ONCOGENE, BASINGSTOKE, HANTS, GB, vol. 24, 4 April 2005 (2005-04-04), pages 3987-3994, XP003013793 ISSN: 0950-9232'}, {'document': 'ENDOH M ET AL: ""RASSF2, a potential tumour suppressor, is silenced by CpG island hypermethylation in gastric cancer"" BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER, vol. 93, no. 12, December 2005 (2005-12), pages 1395-1399, XP002458486 ISSN: 0007-0920'}, {'document': 'NOSHO KATSUHIKO ET AL: ""Genetic and epigenetic profiling in early colorectal tumors and prediction of invasive potential in pT1 (early invasive) colorectal cancers.""

The system automatically adjusts engine speed based on changes in tire pressure, maintaining a constant vehicle speed while adapting the transmission ratio. In field work, where low tyre pressure is required, the engine speed may be high (e.g., 2100 rpm), but this affects the performance of the onboard compressor used for inflating tires, taking longer than necessary due to reduced air delivery.

The proposed solution is an engine control system that automatically deactivates the fuel-saving mode during tire inflation, increasing engine speed and compressor performance to save approximately 15% of inflation time. The system can be integrated with a tyre pressure control system for easy adjustment of tire pressure.

The patent also includes a safety feature that checks the vehicle's operating mode before changing the engine speed during coast operation to prevent unexpected acceleration, which could cause damage or require manual deceleration. This system is designed to work alongside other automatic driveline controls but may need to be deactivated under certain conditions like constant PTO operation or coasting downhill.

The primary application of this patent is in agricultural tractors equipped with a stepless hydrostatic-mechanical power split drive. The system can also be applied to various transmission systems, including combustion engines with stepped shift transmissions, electric drive systems, and combinations of these. The key technical innovation lies in the automatic mode detection during coast operation and the subsequent adjustment of the engine control system to maintain vehicle safety.","[{'document': 'EP 2101054 A2'}, {'document': 'DE 4014378 A1'}, {'document': 'GB 952374 A'}, {'document': 'GB 2471478 A'}]","[{'document': 'GB 0911309 A'}, {'document': 'GB 0922016 A'}, {'document': 'GB 1016662 A'}, {'document': 'GB 01016661 A'}, {'document': 'GB 1021928 A'}, {'document': 'GB 1021929 A'}, {'document': 'GB 0916233 A'}, {'document': 'GB 0800613 A'}]",[],WO2013000702,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],12,"– Goal 12: The engine control system automatically deactivates modes that reduce fuel consumption, which directly relates to ""achieving sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources"" as it aims to reduce fuel usage in agricultural vehicles.",Mechanical Engineering; Performing Operations & Transport,Engines & Power Machines; Transportation & Vehicles,AGCO International GmbH,CH,1,"BRENNINGER, Martin",DE,1,

The process involves a first step of treatment with ethylene oxide in gaseous phase, which effectively eliminates microorganisms due to its small size and high penetration capacity. This is followed by a second step of treatment with hydrogen peroxide, either in liquid phase (25%-60%, heated to 50°C-70°C) or gaseous phase (vaporized to a concentration greater than 30%). The liquid phase treatment helps solubilize residual nucleic acids and can reach them more effectively in porous materials, while the gaseous phase treatment is applicable to consumables pre-packed in gas-permeable packaging.

The combination of these two steps provides a more thorough decontamination than previous techniques, eliminating undesirable amplification even when residual nucleic acids are initially contained in microorganisms. This method is particularly useful for filter devices made from materials like polypropylene, PES, or PVDF and is applicable to DNA (PCR) and RNA (TMA) samples. The patent indicates that a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide (30%) is more effective in degrading free nucleic acids compared to a lower concentration (3%), but it has no effect on nucleic acids contained within microorganisms.

The results show that this method is more effective than traditional sterilization methods like gamma radiation in eliminating residual nucleic acids, particularly for consumables containing filters or membranes made of polypropylene, PES, or PVDF. The process guarantees DNA-free consumables of bacterial origin and can be applied to simple or complex consumables, proving useful in various fields such as molecular biology research and diagnostic applications where contamination by residual nucleic acids must be minimized.","[{'document': 'EP 1792631 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 9320241 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2005007884 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2007044520 A1'}, {'document': 'ARCHER E ET AL: ""Validation of a dual cycle ethylene oxide treatment technique to remove DNA from consumables used in forensic laboratories"", FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL: GENETICS, ELSEVIER BV, NETHERLANDS, vol. 4, no. 4, 1 July 2010 (2010-07-01), pages 239-243, XP027078777, ISSN: 1872-4973, DOI: DOI:10.1016/J.FSIGEN.2009.10.004 [retrieved on 2009-11-14]'}, {'document': 'SHAW KIRSTY ET AL: ""Comparison of the effects of sterilisation techniques on subsequent DNA profiling"", INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE, vol. 122, no. 1, January 2008 (2008-01), pages 29-33, XP002636408, ISSN: 0937-9827'}, {'document': '""MS Syringe Filters"", , 13 October 2009 (2009-10-13), XP055119377, Retrieved from the Internet: URL:http://www.chromtech.net.au/pdf2/ms_sy ring_filter09.pdf [retrieved on 2014-05-21]'}, {'document': 'T Schmidt ET AL: ""Evidence of contamination in PCR laboratory disposables"", Naturwissenschaften, vol. 82, no. 9, 1 September 1995 (1995-09-01), pages 423-431, XP055119496,'}, {'document': 'KANEMITSU KEIJI ET AL: ""A comparative study of ethylene oxide gas, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and low-temperature steam formaldehyde sterilization"", INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, vol. 26, no. 5, May 2005 (2005-05), pages 486-489, ISSN: 0899-823X'}]","[{'document': 'WO 9320241 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2007044520 A'}, {'document': 'EP 1792631 A'}, {'document': 'WO 2005007884 A'}, {'document': 'VOSBERG, H.P.

cycloalkylidene compounds, functioning as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). These compounds offer potential solutions for various non-reproductive tissue-related diseases and conditions, such as osteoporosis, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, menopausal or postmenopausal disorders, depression, and more. The key innovation lies in the compound's ability to selectively act as estrogen agonists or antagonists in different tissues, achieved through its capacity to induce distinct conformational states of the estrogen receptor and recruit specific proteins involved in transcriptional regulation.

The patent also outlines methods for synthesizing these cycloalkylidene compounds and related derivatives using standard organic chemistry techniques, including the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The primary application of these synthesized compounds is within the field of organic chemistry for research purposes, potentially in drug discovery or material science. The synthesized compounds primarily serve as intermediates in the production of other chemical compounds, with potential applications in pharmaceuticals, materials science, or other fields where they may exhibit desirable properties.

Furthermore, the patent includes a focus on a series of chemical compounds that have been synthesized and tested for their ability to bind to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ). These compounds demonstrated pIC50 values ranging from 6 to 8.5, indicating their potential as estrogen receptor modulators. The research adhered to the principles of laboratory animal care and GlaxoSmithKline policy on animal use. It is important to note that this invention is not limited to the specific examples provided in the patent description.","[{'document': 'WO 2005012220 A2'}, {'document': 'JP 2000072612 A'}, {'document': 'MUTHYALA R S ET AL: ""BRIDGED BICYCLIC CORES CONTAINING A 1,1-DIARYLETHYLENE MOTIF ARE HIGH-AFFINITY SUBTYPE-SELECTIVE LIGANDS FOR THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR"" JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY, AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY, US, vol. 46, no. 9, 2003, pages 1589-1602, XP001204850 ISSN: 0022-2623'}]","[{'document': 'WO 9709348 A'}, {'document': 'Kousteni et al.

This technique targets the mitotic phase of cell division in eukaryotes, specifically focusing on the ""cleavage furrow"" of dividing cells. The electric field is applied through insulated electrodes and an electric field source that generates non-homogeneous electric fields, causing selective damage to tumor cells without significant harm to normal tissue.

The primary application of this technology is in cancer treatment, aiming to reduce side effects associated with existing methods like radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The system can be applied through various means, including skin patches, implanted electrodes, hats, clothing, probes, and collars, depending on the tumor's location. For instance, a self-adhesive flexible patch is described for treating tumors on or slightly below the skin surface, while a Transcranial Capacitive (TC) fields system can be integrated into clothing like hats for treating intra-cranial tumors.

Key technical innovations include creating non-uniform electric fields that exert forces on polarized objects within cells, disrupting cell structure and organization, eventually leading to the breakage of the cell membrane. The system utilizes materials with high dielectric constants to prevent excessive voltage drop across the patch and uses protective features like a loose net or thin conductive coating to prevent mechanical damage.

To enhance effectiveness, proper placement of the electrodes is essential, ensuring that protected areas are not exposed to high field density. The system is designed for comfort during long treatment periods while maintaining effectiveness, with a Transcranial Current (TC) therapy delivery system primarily designed for treating tumors. This system includes a detachable unit with an insulated electrode, biasing mechanism, and adhesive rim for secure attachment to the skin, which can be integrated into various articles of clothing or custom-made devices.

To mitigate potential discomfort or burns, a floating conductor within the conductive gel member is proposed. Additionally, the patent introduces a method for controlling electric field density using conductive structures like nets or plates, creating a Faraday cage effect around certain organs while focusing high-density electric fields on targeted areas like tumors. This method aims to protect nearby organs from side effects and potentially reduce costs associated with high-dielectric constant insulation materials. The primary application of this technology is in medical treatments involving electric fields, such as tumor ablation or stimulation therapies.","[{'document': 'EP 0330797 A'}, {'document': 'WO 0160994 A'}, {'document': 'GB 1419660 A'}, {'document': 'GB 2026322 A'}, {'document': 'GB 2043453 A'}, {'document': 'US 2220269 A'}, {'document': 'US 3915151 A'}, {'document': 'US 4467809 A'}, {'document': 'US 5269304 A'}, {'document': 'US 6413255 B1'}]","[{'document': 'US 6043066 A'}, {'document': 'WO 0160994 A'}, {'document': 'DARNELL et al.

The sheet consists of a three-layered base paper, featuring an inner layer containing papermaking fibers and alkalized fibrous carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a first surface layer with specific beating up freeness to achieve a certain weight ratio, and a second surface layer with a tacky adhesive layer.

The primary purpose of this invention is to improve the longevity of the tacky adhesive layer in water-dispersible labels without compromising their water dispersibility. This is achieved by using a base paper with a multilayer structure, where each layer has specific combinations of papermaking fibers and alkalized CMC. The alkalization process converts the water-insoluble fibrous carboxymethyl cellulose to a water-soluble form, making the base paper water dispersible.

The second surface layer features a water-soluble or water re-dispersible acrylic tacky adhesive with various crosslinking agents, plasticizers, tackifiers, and other additives to adjust properties. On the opposite side of the sheet, additional layers such as a thermosensitive recording layer or an inkjet recording layer can be installed, depending on the application.

The patent also describes a method for creating a thermosensitive recording layer on the base paper for use in thermal printing. This layer is formed using various printing methods and a binder, with additives depending on the desired properties. The binder can be selected from a wide range of water-soluble or dispersible resins such as polyvinyl alcohols, modified polyvinyl alcohols, starch, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and others. Additives like pigments, surfactants, lubricants, and pressure coloring inhibitors can also be used.

The primary application of this invention is in thermal printing, with adaptations for use in inkjet printers and gravure printing. The key technical innovation lies in the creation of a three-layered base paper with a thermosensitive recording layer and a tacky adhesive layer on either side. The water-dispersible sheet can be easily removed from the substrate by rinsing it off with water, making it suitable for printing systems that require a water-dispersible sheet, such as thermal printers or inkjet printers, where the printed material can be washed away after use.","[{'document': 'EP 0462770 A1'}, {'document': 'EP 2441869 A1'}, {'document': 'EP 2599914 A1'}, {'document': 'EP 1705288 A2'}, {'document': 'JP 2004314623 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2006299498 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2012061612 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2012214937 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2016003419 A'}, {'document': 'JP H09121939 A'}, {'document': 'US 2005123753 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2009252905 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2014318726 A1'}]","[{'document': 'JP H0949188 B'}, {'document': 'JP 2004314623 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2006299498 A'}, {'document': 'JP H04370300 B'}, {'document': 'EP 1705288 A'}]",[],WO2018088179,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],6,"– Goal 6: The patent describes a ""waterdispersible sheet"", which can contribute to clean water and sanitation by reducing the persistence of paper waste in aquatic environments.

The proposed solution involves a unique design that includes a capacity line, an admission line, and an extraction line within the multi-stage steam turbine. This configuration allows for an increase in swallowing capacity (flow passing ability), serving as both a means to enhance the turbine's performance under lower steam conditions and a drain line for condensate from the admission lines.

Key technical innovations include the use of an orifice plate or box in the capacity line to control flow-rate, connecting the capacity line to an admission line at a low point to enable draining of condensate through the capacity line when needed, and incorporating a stop valve and a drain bypass line to manage condensate flow during valve closure.

The primary application of this invention is in power generation plants where steam turbines are used, particularly those experiencing fluctuations in back pressure due to deteriorating steam generator performance over time. The increased swallowing capacity allows for more efficient operation and potential recovery of some output capacity despite lower steam conditions. This method can be advantageous as it offers a cost-effective retrofit solution that can adjust the swallowing capacity of the steam turbine to match its load without requiring significant modifications to the turbine, control system, or operating actions. The primary application is in improving the power generation capabilities of steam turbines under lower steam conditions, making them more efficient and potentially extending their operational life.","[{'document': 'FR 2426158 A1'}, {'document': 'JP 2013151876 A'}, {'document': 'US 2014366537 A1'}]",[{'document': 'FR 2426158 A1'}],[],,"['AL', 'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'CH', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DE', 'DK', 'EE', 'ES', 'FI', 'FR', 'GB', 'GR', 'HR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IS', 'IT', 'LI', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MC', 'MK', 'MT', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'RS', 'SE', 'SI', 'SK', 'SM', 'TR']",[],[],7,"– Goal 7: The patent describes a ""steam turbine 10 having a plurality of stages"" which can contribute to increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.",,,General Electric Technology GmbH,CH,1,"Jourdain, Vincent; Toulemonde, Martin",FR,2,

The main objective is to address the deficiency of certain clotting proteins in patients with disorders like hemophilia A.

The key innovation involves transfecting stromal cells with genes encoding biologically active enzymes, such as Factor VIII-C or anti-Thrombin III, which can adhere to a bone cavity surface and produce the active enzyme upon introduction into the patient, addressing the deficiency by secreting it into the bloodstream.

The patent also introduces the GBLneor cell line, derived from the GBL/6 cell line, which supports hematopoiesis in vitro without detectable quantities of known hematopoietic growth factors and produces macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).

The primary application of this method is for treating genetic disorders like hemophilia A, offering advantages over existing treatments such as plasma-derived products due to their inefficiency, high costs, risks of infection, and contamination with adventitious agents. The invention emphasizes the use of autologous or histocompatible cells to minimize immunologic rejection and obviate general immune suppression of the recipient.

The patent also includes methods for engrafting human Factor VIII-C into mice using irradiated stromal cells, determining the optimum number of stromal cells for maximum Factor VIII-C production, and proposes a similar method for treating hemophilia-A in humans using stromal cell transplantation.

The patent's primary application lies in the field of cell biology and hematopoiesis, particularly for creating and studying stromal cell lines that support hematopoietic stem cell growth. The GBLneor cell line could potentially be used in research related to bone marrow transplantation, hematopoietic disorders, and drug testing.

describes an innovative method and apparatus for seamlessly transferring a connection involving a wireless terminal (e.g., smartphone) from a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network to another network, such as UTRAN/GERAN, during Circuit Switched Fallback (CSFB). The primary focus is on improving the process of CSFB, which allows an LTE device to fall back to legacy WCDMA or GSM networks when Internet Protocol (VoIP) capabilities are not supported.

The method includes two options for transferring radio connections from LTE to UTRAN/GERAN: Packet Switched handover (CS Fallback with PSHO), which has a short data interruption time, and RRC connection release with redirection to UTRAN/GERAN (CS Fallback with RWR), which provides a robust solution but has a longer packet switched (PS) outage time.

Enhancements to the CS Fallback with RRC connection release with redirection (Enhanced CS Fallback RWR) are also discussed, aiming to optimize service characteristics, particularly reducing the CS voice setup time. In case of handover failure, a multiple transfer attempt procedure is employed, allowing the wireless terminal to perform a second type of transfer, which is releasing and re-establishing the connection in a selected cell of the other radio access network instead of returning to the LTE network.

The patent's key technical innovations include:
1. A multiple transfer attempt procedure that allows a wireless terminal to release and re-establish the connection in another radio access network when the initial handover attempt fails.
2. Improving call success rates for speech calls during CSFB with PSHO by implementing a second type of transfer.
3. Allowing the wireless terminal to perform the second type of transfer based on an alternative transfer authorization included in the handover command message from the LTE network.

The primary applications of this technology are:
1. Improving call success rates for speech calls during CSFB with PSHO.
2. Enhancing the performance of wireless networks by reducing call drops and improving handover efficiency.
3. Facilitating seamless roaming for users moving between different radio access networks.

The patent text describes an innovative method for handling handover failures in wireless communication systems, involving attempting a second transfer procedure (connection release and connection re-establishment) when the first transfer procedure (handover) fails. This process is facilitated by a failure indication sent from the LTE radio access network to the non-LTE radio access network, requesting resource release for the failed handover and authorizing the use of the second transfer procedure.

The patent references several 3GPP standards related to GPRS enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access, Circuit Switched (CS) fallback in Evolved Packet System (EPS), UTRAN Iu interface Radio Access Network Application Part (RANAP) signaling, Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification (UTRAN), and Radio Resource Control (RRC), Pro. The patent text describes key components and protocols of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in mobile communication networks, focusing on two primary signaling systems: RAN Application Part (RANAP) and Radio Resource Control (RRC).","[{'document': 'US 2010234026 A1'}, {'document': 'US 2010316000 A1'}, {'document': 'ALCATEL-LUCENT ET AL: ""Correction of CSFB"", 3GPP DRAFT; R3-101145_CSFB, 3RD GENERATION PARTNERSHIP PROJECT (3GPP), MOBILE COMPETENCE CENTRE ; 650, ROUTE DES LUCIOLES ; F-06921 SOPHIA-ANTIPOLIS CEDEX ; FRANCE, vol.

The key technical advancement is the use of anchor pivots that allow each tuft to rotate independently, addressing the issue of two tufts being secured together and unable to rotate independently in previous designs.

The toothbrush head consists of five groups of tufts with varying lengths, angles, and functions for effective tooth cleaning. These include perimeter tufts that extend above the head, larger oval-shaped tufts, inner tufts that extend perpendicular to the head, and inner tufts that lean across each other at a five-degree angle. A unique group includes pivoting tufts that can move up to 15 degrees during use for improved cleaning efficiency.

The patent also proposes a manufacturing method involving molding a plastic head in two distinct portions that can be moved towards each other after removal from the mold, allowing water to flow through the head for better cleanability. The process involves heating and cooling specific parts of the head to achieve this flexibility.

Additionally, the patent suggests alternative tooth cleaning elements like elastomeric fins instead of bristles. The patent describes a novel design for a toothbrush bristle made of Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE), with textured ribs on the bristle to enhance oral cavity cleaning.

The primary application of this toothbrush design is for oral hygiene purposes, providing effective cleaning due to its unique tuft arrangement and pivoting capabilities.

These modifications include attaching polymeric molecules like PEG for extended functional in vivo half-life, improved solubility, and reduced immunogenicity. The primary applications of these IL-21 derivatives are in the treatment and study of immune system disorders and diseases such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, cancer due to their potential antitumor activity mediated by natural killer cells.

Additionally, the patent covers methods for creating lipid-modified IL-21 derivatives with lipophilic substituents to enhance stability and bioactivity. These modifications involve forming amide bonds between the peptide, spacer, and lipophilic substituent. The primary applications of these lipid-modified IL-21 derivatives are expected to be in therapeutics, particularly immunotherapy and treatment of autoimmune diseases.

The patent includes methods for stabilizing liquid pharmaceutical compositions containing a polypeptide like IL-21 by adding various stabilizers such as methionine, antimicrobial preservatives, isotonic agents, chelating agents, high molecular weight polymers or low molecular compounds. The primary application of this invention is to prevent aggregate formation and maintain the biological activity of polypeptide-based therapeutics during storage, thereby improving their efficacy and reducing issues such as blockage during administration.

The patent also describes methods for creating stable formulations of proteins like IL-21 using various techniques including crystallization, emulsification, high pressure homogenization, encapsulation, and microencapsulation. These formulations can be administered via parenteral injection, nasal or pulmonary spray, transdermal injection, or transmucosal administration (buccal). A key innovation involves pegylating IL-21 using sodium periodate and a PEG-derivative to increase its physical and chemical stability. The pegylated IL-21 maintains similar potency in a proliferation assay as the unpegylated standard, indicating that the pegylation does not interfere with receptor binding. The primary application of this stabilized formulation is in pharmaceuticals, particularly for improving the half-life and potential efficacy of IL-21 for therapeutic applications. An experimental study involving the administration of hIL-21, PEG20k-hIL-21, and PEG40k-hIL-21 to mice is described for pharmacokinetic analysis, which could potentially lead to advancements in immunotherapy or drug development.","[{'document': 'WO 0053761 A'}, {'document': 'US 4902502 A'}, {'document': 'US 2003186387 A1'}, {'document': 'KATRE N: ""The conjugation of proteins with polyethylene glycol and other polymers.

The key technical innovation involves aggregating microvesicles with a polyvalent cationic substance, typically a cationic polymer like polylysine or protamine, due to their electrical properties. This aggregation process makes the microvesicles easier to capture by a filter and facilitates their extraction.

The method consists of four main steps: aggregating microvesicles with the cationic substance, capturing the aggregate on a filter, releasing the aggregate from the filter using a buffer solution, and separating the microvesicles from the aggregate using an elution solution containing chaotropic agents or proteases. The use of this method eliminates the need for centrifugation, reducing cost and time compared to conventional methods.

The primary application of this method is in molecular diagnosis, particularly for early disease detection, as microvesicles contain microRNA that can serve as useful markers. The extracted microvesicles can be further analyzed in various fields such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and research on cellular communication and disease mechanisms.

The patent also describes two additional methods for isolating extracellular vesicles (EVs): one using poly-L-lysine (PLL) to aggregate EVs followed by centrifugation and washing steps, and another using a commercial PEG solution or a spin column-type extracellular vesicle isolation kit. The PLL aggregation method is found to yield higher EV yields and purity ratios compared to other methods, preserving the RNA content of EVs better.

The invention further explores the effects of incubation temperature and PLL concentration on the formation of EV-PLL aggregates, finding that lower temperatures promote more efficient aggregation. To dissolve the strongly aggregated EV-PLL pellets for subsequent application, a chaotropic agent called GuTc is used.

This patent presents three methods for isolating extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are small membrane-enclosed particles that play crucial roles in intercellular communication. These methods aim to improve the efficiency and speed of diagnostic processes, potentially being useful in various industrial fields where microvesicles are utilized.","[{'document': 'WO 2017178472 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2017178472 A1'}, {'document': 'WO 2016109799 A2'}, {'document': 'KR 20080111487 A'}, {'document': 'KR 20170019270 A'}, {'document': 'KR 20180118326 A'}, {'document': 'KR 20190012130 A'}, {'document': 'MARIA YU.

The process involves sensitizing human antibody-producing cells with a virus or its protein/glycoprotein in vitro before fusing them with mouse myeloma cells. The resulting hybridomas produce specific human monoclonal antibodies against the viruses used for sensitization. This method can be applied to any type of virus, and various mitogens can be used for sensitizing the human antibody-producing cells.

The patent specifically describes the production of monoclonal antibodies against Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV). For HSV, three types of monoclonal antibodies (D34, H2, and H3) are developed that react specifically with HSV-1 and HSV-2. The anti-HSV monoclonal antibody reacts with the cell membrane and cytoplasm of HSV infected cells and primarily reacts with glycoprotein B.

For VZV, three monoclonal antibodies (V1, V2, and V6) are developed that specifically recognize certain glycoproteins from the Varicella-Zoster Virus. The antibodies V1 and V2 exhibit excellent neutralizing activity against VZV.

The patent also includes a process for producing monoclonal antibodies against CMV through cell fusion, sensitizing CMV antigens in vitro.

In summary, this patent presents an innovative method for producing monoclonal antibodies that can specifically bind to and neutralize HSV-1 and HSV-2, as well as a process for producing monoclonal antibodies against VZV and CMV. The primary applications of these methods are in the field of virology, particularly in the study and treatment of herpesviruses, offering advantages over mouse antibodies due to their increased specificity and safety for human use.","[{'document': 'EP 0148644 A'}, {'document': 'JP 5417185 A'}, {'document': 'JP 58128323 A'}]",[],[],WO8602092,"['CH', 'DE', 'FR', 'GB', 'IT', 'LI', 'NL', 'SE']",[],[],3,"– Goal 3: The patent explicitly addresses the development of ""human monoclonal antibody which reacts specifically to varicella zoster virus"" and ""herpes simplex virusreacting human monoclonal antibody"", directly contributing to combating communicable diseases.",Chemistry & Metallurgy; Human Necessities,Biochemistry & Biotechnology; Chemical Processes; Medical & Healthcare,TEIJIN LIMITED,JP,1,"MASUFO, Yasuhiko; MATSUMOTO, Yoh-Ichi; SUGANO, Toru; TOMIBE, Katsuhiko",JP,4,

The key technical innovation involves a design that minimizes wear on the check valve by preventing the ball within it from eccentrically hitting against the guide part (valve seat), thereby extending its lifespan.

The check valve consists of a cylindrical valve case, a ball, a valve seat, a spring, and a spring seat. The fluid flows along the axial direction of the valve case and out through outflow ports, ensuring the flow direction almost coincides with the movable direction of the ball.

The invention is particularly useful in hybrid vehicles, where it is applied to the supplying oil passage from the mechanical pump, a main oil passage of the transmission for hybrid vehicles. The check valve is fixed to the case of the gear-change mechanism section and disposed between the valve body, preventing eccentric abrasion of the valve.

Additional features include concave channels formed along the axial direction on the inner peripheral face of the valve case, allowing accurate movement of the ball while contacting with the inner peripheral face of the valve case. The check valve is designed to have multiple concave channels and outflow ports for smoothing the flow of fluid in the check valve and preventing pressure loss from increasing.

The primary application of this patent is in hybrid vehicle power transmissions, where it ensures proper hydraulic pressure for the hydraulic control unit by preventing oil from flowing backward into the mechanical oil pump when the motor-operated oil pump is operating. The check valve is mounted so that its axial direction almost coincides with gravity.

The design includes a spring seat, which engages with the valve case's supporting sections, ensuring stability even under hydraulic pressure. A stopper section within the spring seat restricts the ball's vertical movement and prevents it from sliding excessively within the valve case. The oil flow path is designed to minimize loss and pressure drop by having multiple routes of outflow passages with some oil passing through perforated holes in the stopper section.

The invention can be applied to check valves in fluid passages from mechanical or motor-operated pumps and is suitable for various vehicular transmissions like automatic transmissions.","[{'document': 'EP 1336773 A2'}, {'document': 'WO 9913252 A1'}, {'document': 'DE 19622123 A1'}, {'document': 'DE 20213267 U1'}, {'document': 'JP 06185644 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2001182814 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2001280458 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2001504931 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2003130189 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2005212494 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2005315271 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2006070976 A'}, {'document': 'JP 01113676 U'}, {'document': 'JP 04077070 U'}, {'document': 'US 2005169765 A1'}]","[{'document': 'JP 2001041066 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2001280458 A'}, {'document': 'JP H01113676 U'}, {'document': 'JP H0477070 U'}, {'document': 'WO 9913252 A'}, {'document': 'JP H06185644 A'}, {'document': 'US 20050169765 A1'}, {'document': 'DE 19622123 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2003130189 A'}, {'document': 'EP 1336773 A'}, {'document': 'JP 2005315271 A'}]",[],WO2007058055,"['DE', 'FR', 'GB']",[],[],7,"– Goal 7: The patent describes a ""transmission for hybrid vehicle which has an internal combustion engine 2 and electric motors 3, 4 as said driving sources"", which contributes to cleaner energy by improving hybrid vehicle technology.
